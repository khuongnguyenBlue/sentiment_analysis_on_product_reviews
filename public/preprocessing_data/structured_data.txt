1,I don't use Facebook Messenger often but when I do it is always reliable.
0,The phone feature don't work as it should, sometimes the app will freeze.
0,It is kind of a pest, like being interrupted when doing something else...
0,too envasive on my privacy and things it can to do my computer and phone.
1,I want to say thanks for your help to Heather and Geronimo wonderful help
1,Easy to use. I like the notification when receiving a FB Messenger call.
0,If I could I'd give it zero stars it force closes when u wanna video chat
0,It is a great app, but it is a little slow, coming up on the Kindle Fire.
1,The FB messenger allows me to avoid work and keep in contact with friends
0,Do not like the fact I have to have the messenger app just to chat on FB.
1,Luv it. So much easier than texting
1,Love it! Great way to stay in touch
1,This is fast and accurate. Love it.

1,A great app.works great on my kindle.helps to keep in touch with people.
1,Great app to connect as a text instead of using Facebook to communicate.
0,It's a useful & quick method of conversation and to connect with others.
1,quick, fun, with a great video chat option that's a joy to use, love it!
1,Great......still just learning the ropes, but I am enjoying the new app.
0,I tried to load this on my Kindle Fire numerous times and it won't load.
1,Great service. To get a. Unvalable person with data of important nature.
1,It's great having it on my Kindle. I wish it was free on my smart phone.
1,Facebook Messenger works just as good as the old MSN Explorer messenger.
1,This app makes it possible to text my son and his fiance in New Zealand.
1,This app does not work for other people on their kindle fire which confuses me. Mine works perfectly fine I just dont see the problem people are having :(
1,Place this app on my Kindle Fire HD and my Samsung tablet and they coordinate beautifully! Now I can get messages on my cell phone, Kindle and my tablet!!
1,Wife uses Facebook Messenger on Kindle and android phone to call her friends and sister abroad. All the girls use it in place of regular cell phone calls.
1,This is nice, when you get off facebook (on my Kindle Fire too) and the symbol pops up with a message, you do not miss someone trying to reach you! COOL!
0,Does not let me use the chat head, no notifications unless you hear it beep, you wouldn't know if u had a msg. User needs to constantly check for msgs....
0,It's okay but I don't trust Facebook with my private information. There are other chat mediums that perform better and provide a better level of security.
1,TO USE CHAT BUBBLES: Navigate to app settings, tap on 'Chat Heads', Disable 'Hide when using full screen apps'. It works perfectly after doing my instructions above, and is quite smooth. Hope this helped :)
1,great app. Nice convenience to see on the desktop screen if I have a message verse having to go to internet and login to website. recommend this app
1,It works great for me. My daughter has limited texting on her plan, but she has Facebook Messenger and this way we can text as much as we want. Thanks!
1,This works really good on my kindle. Very happy with it. I would recommend to anyone on facebook!! Fast and easy way of chatting with friends and family.
1,I love this app. It is the only way I get to talk to my husband, who is a truck driver and we never know where he is going to be.
0,this app is great for talking to my friends and stuff. but the chat bubble wouldn't popup when I'm on seperate games. plz fix!!!1!
0,This sucks I thought it would work when I saw the 5 stars but Facebook is crap for not letting the kindle users able to use it!!!!
1,Love this!! A little picture of the person pops up to let you know someone has messaged you. No need to be on Facebook to see it.
0,Would not install on my Kindle Fire. "Corrupted', was the message. Demand a refund! Wait Wait twas free! Worth every farthing!
1,Everyone says this is not compatible with kindle fires??! I have the newest kindle fire ands it works great on it thanks Facebook!
0,The fact that I NEED to download this to actually check Facebook messages is FRACKING ANNOYING. Build it into one App - seriously.
0,are you serious ?????is there anything the kindle fire can do? I jhave had 10. in 3 years!!!!! makes great doorstops not much else
0,Downloaded on Kindle and it caused havoc. Couldn't delete people or conversations. And the Kindle made phone calls WTH. Deleted it
0,I think it's f****** ridiculous that we are now forced to have messenger 1 it takes up space on the cell phone I say get rid of it
0,Despite negative reviews about not working on the Kindle Fire I decided to try anyway. Yeah no, BIG mistake. Really Amazon, you offer an App in store thru my Kindle, but it fails to mention non-compatibility with the Fire itself?! How sad that both you and FB couldn't figure this out in well over a year.
0,I hate it. It's the most annoying app I've ever dealt with but I have no choice if I want people to be able to privately message me. Popping up on my screen when I'm busy with something else? Stupid. If I read it it shows the other party that it's been read, so now I'm rude for not immediately getting back to them. There's enough of that with texting. This app is a giant pain.
1,I've never had any problems with this app on the kindle fire. It's fast and the notifications work just fine. I've had more problems with it failing to work on android devices, but perhaps that's because they have less memory.
0,I'm it a huge fan of separate apps for the same overall app. But I do enjoy chat heads. Unfortunately chat heads don't seem to work at all with the kindle fire HDX 7". Which is sad since it's the only redeeming feature.
0,We all know messenger was better when it was still part of fb. Now it eats m.b. faster then ever and I see nothing different but more problems. Same as fb. M says it 1.7 g.b app but you end up with close to fourth and it's constantly turning itself on using data you didn't auth. Garbage app
0,It works for the &#34;Amazon Fire Phone&#34; all though I was sketched out over the controversy about how it used through the government to be In Our business, but it isn't true so. Rock on messenger. Oh and besides the fact I have to download messnenger just to reply to my Facebook messages.
0,Very good in keeping everything synced. My only complaint is, is when I have this installed on multiple devices they all go off when I get PM'd or messaged. Wish it had some sort of smart coding or options to only respond to the current device I'm using while keeping all the others synced at the same time.
1,I got this App with ease..was free. But unfortunately I have a Kindle Fire and it has no mike or camera ability. Too bad, but I love my Kindle Fire and will have to wait until I get a new one someday.Up date I recently found out that newer Kindle Fire HD's ARE compatible with FB Messenger! Perfect!.
0,Didn't like it at all. I use a tablet and they make it impossible to get rid of the little face once someone has sent you a message. So I had all these little heads all over my screen. It was ridiculous. Had to delete the app to get rid of them. Do not recommend for tablet users.
0,I don't know why but keeps cutting out on me, maybe they need to do some work on it, on my pc I use an app called easy chat and it works great, so that's what I use on pc, but I can't get it on my tablet because it is windows 10 app.
1,Great App

1,all right
1,Excellent
1,I love FB because it keeps me closer to family & friends. Distance is a problem as well as the expenses that tag along with traveling. There are others problems like age & vision that prevent me from driving at night. Thank You FB for putting a smile on my face with all the family pictures and keeping families just a little closer.
0,Always seems to take too long to connect & load, and doesn't accurately reflect if your messages have been seen by the recipient. I usually just check my messages through Facebook online instead because it's easier.
0,1i prefer tumbler or snap chat better than this app but its ok I guess I'm bored zzz zzz zzz
1,This is written from a different point of view which I found very interesting! The story doesn't ignore or emphasize the other aspects of the war which we often hear about. I highly recommend this book even if one doesn't know a great deal about war planes. I very much enjoyed and appreciated this story!
0,I run Facebook on a Kindle Fire with no issues including sending private messages. For some reason, FB Messenger does not run on the Kindle Fire operating system. App needs some further development.
1,Works great, it helps me keep in touch with my friends who do not have phones, and those overseas. App sometimes interferes with other apps that are full screen. The messenger app is at times not accessible.
1,OMG it works for Kindle Fire it takes a while to load at 1st u have to go home a couple times and launch it couple times BUT IT WORKS PERFECT When u get a message when ur not on the app a message bubble will pop up anywhere and u click on it, it creates a small chat wherever u r and u can click to the left for more options also u can create groups with nicknames different colours designed colours it's so cool plz get
0,How horrible is it that they don't want you to message in facebook anymore! Have to download the app if you are running android now. Messaging is much better when it is all in the Facebook app itself.
1,I've seen many reviews claiming this doesn't work on the kindle fire he. I have this on the 2013 Kindle Fire HD and it works just as it's supposed to. Great app. And to appear offline to others(No Green Dot or Active message) turn chat off in both This app and facebook mobile app.
1,I like it overall, not having any negative things to say about it. It links up inside Facebook nicely while there and so the messages can be read and answered from within. Also, as a seperate app, you can use on it's own which can be nice also.
0,I do not like it...removed app
1,Not what I expected, but good!
0,Have to get acquainted with it
1,This works so great on Kindle.

1,Quick way of receiving messages vs. email. Use it constantly.
1,I've only used this app a few times and it works like a charm!
1,You all are lying I downloaded it and used it with no problems
0,some of the software over rides my Facebook. Gonna delete it.
1,I was hoping that you could do a few more unique things on it.
0,I can't open a text from Facebook app and my fire phone freeze
0,Don't feel it was necessary for messenger to have its own app!
0,Was not needed for Facebook and I don't like the fact of being forced to download it
1,-1 Star for the mandatory install, but otherwise works a treat once you're used to it.
1,Not my first rodeo with Amazon Kindle. Loved it the first time and I'm loving it now.
1,I like it better than Messenger on IPhone. A bit more NOISEY. Sometimes annoying too.
1,It is really good to quickly keep in touch with others. The emoticons are great to use
1,This is awesome! I am using it on my kindle right now actually!! It works really well!
0,This just an app get get information off you cell phone so that facebook can sale it.
1,I must download to receive messages on FB. Wonderful features like animated stickers.

1,I love messenger because Ican communicate w my family in Peru my original country
1,Works awesome. Use it to make voice phone calls to our kid stationed in Okinawa.
0,Deleted. Wanted access to my phone files & contacts. No privacy settings control.
0,While this app works great on my phone...it does not work on the Kindle Fire HDX.
1,Works in a pinch when I'm away from my computer and someone needs to contact me.
1,I just wish the chat heads would quit crashing, other than that it's a great app
1,Pretty self explanatory. This is the Facebook messenger app and works just fine.
1,Amazing. I don't understand what you people are complaining about it works fine.

0,so far so good
1,So far so good
1,As I expected!
0,Stopped woking
1,It alerts me to any Facebook private messages and it is free. Just got it the other day. I'm guessing that is all it does. Hit the button and it takes you to your message.
0,I kept it on my kindle for about a week. It kept freezing my kindle, finally resulting in no programs opening at all. I deleted the app and everything went back to normal.
0,I didn't really care for the icon being on my Kindle screen all the time when I was doing other things. I find that I keep turning it off. I will probably uninstall it.
1,I like talking to people I know, but I do not want stranger men try picking me out, to old for that at 61 years of age, I don't know how to stop it requesting me to end.
0,sometimes it crashes and I have to restart my cellular other then that its okay. think this app needs much work but it might just be that it does not go well with my cel
0,What's wrong with texting? I'm fully capable of switching back and forth between Facebook and my texting app. I don't like that they force this battery sucking app on me.
0,Every time I scroll through my feed if there's a video it freezes the app it doesn't crash or anything it just freezes and stops working complete garbage because of that.
0,Error downloading on 7 inch fire tablet, ironically, it downloaded just fine on my husbands exact same model, on the same network, connected to the same account. Help???
1,Just an ap but it works great on the kindle ! I don't use ap's on my kindle but I do use Messenger and Facebook- I never inte ever to use the kindle for aps I should say.
1,hshsj jays. jsusj hsjsb. shshsus. sushehd. shsysu hshsgs hshdhs gshdhs hshdhe hdhdhd hdhdhd hdhdhd hshshs hshshdh hshdhdg hshshsh hshsgdh hshdhdg bdhdgdh hdhdhdh hdhdyd
0,After seeing a post on my Kindle Tablet, I will have the picture of the person last spoken too keep popping up and wont close completely. I have to reboot the tablet to get rid of it. But it does make communication with some people easier but not sure I would have downloaded this to my tablet if I knew the "cons" and not just the "pros".
1,Use it ALL THE TIME. It sure came in handy recently when I had to be without a phone for 2 weeks. My son was changing cellphone providers. He lives 500 miles away from me & travels all over the Western US for his work. I mailed him my phone & it took 2 weeks before I received my new one. It was horrible being without a phone. But, thanks to Facebook Messenger, I wasn't completely disconnected to all my friends & family. It's user friendly & the auto correction is the smartest one I've used. And did I mention that it's free? Yes, it's really free. Try it. You have nothing to lose.
1,This game is captivating, does not get boring and is great for improving memory and visual skills. My husband and I both enjoy without spending money. It has plenty of rewards that you can cash in for more game time. Love it!
0,Just downloaded this finally after reading other reviews wasn't going to do it but went ahead . Working on my Kindle Fire Hd good so far . After downloading this facebook messenger and signing in then had to update it. Sent messages to friends the replied back on this app. Even got a message dot on front of my carousel letting me know I received a message back. Hope this continues to work right after all my friends and family are on this now . 3 stars so far cause I haven't had this app downloaded to long on my Kindle Fire Hd . But happy with it right now :) Thanks Amazon for this free app now I can FINALLY join my friends and family on here !!
1,I love face book messenger app on my phone. My phone dings when I get a Facebook message. You don't have to wait until you go online to Facebook to get the message. You can click on the icon and go straight to the message to read the message and reply right from your phone. It is just like using text messaging on your phone. I don't have everyone's cell number that is my friend on Facebook so this makes it easy to get in touch quickly with those friends without having to track down someone who has their number. If you know they are on Facebook often this is the way to get in touch. It works well with my I phone. I haven't found any reason not to continue to use it on my I phone 5S. It was easy to install on my phone and easy to use. It is a good tool for me I use it all the time.
1,The app does its job quite well. There's only one minor problem that has been bugging ever since I had installed this app. For some reason, the app keeps updating itself as much as twice every single day. I'm not sure if it's supposed to do that or if I'm the only one experiencing this. Either way, I'd like some answers. Overall though, solid app.
1,Definitely better for fire hd 6 than iPhone 5... the ability to see the "face bubbles" makes it sooo much easier than opening and closing the app no matter what.. I can't believe iPhones/iPads still make you exit the screen to respond.. I got this for my fire and I love it.. It's like a breath of fees air haha!
1,I use this every single day! All day! Husband and kids and parents and everyone else contact me threw it when I am at home because I have no single yet great wifi! One of the 1st things I download when I reset my cell or get a new one. Its very user friendly and pretty much think-less. Tons or great and easy to use features. I have my daughter in law labeled as Evil Daughter In Law..lol She has me as Wicked Mother In law.. My daughter labeled herself as Loveliest Daughter in the world and me worlds best mommy! Careful though, the other person sees what you tag them as... lol So if you tag someone in your phone as "Love of my Life" or "side Chick" they will know it instantly. You can even change colors of your chats pages now and it has loads of cool emoticons.
1,I like this app, most of the time. I like the fact I don't have to sign in to get my messages and I can see who has sent me the message. It does use alot of space on my phone but I guess that's par for the course.
1,I really like Facebook Messenger. I don't really like logging into FB all the time to see if I have messages from important people in my life or to keep up with messages from groups I belong to. With this app, I can let it run in the background as I am reading or doing other stuff online, and it will notify me when I have a message. The app is easy to use. There are a ton of those emojis you can use if you want to. I can even read the messages in my notifications on my tablet if I want, without having to open the actual app. I can reply with simple thumbs up from within notifications. The reason I knocked it one point is that you can not copy and paste text from messages and it takes up a lot of memory. Otherwise, I find it one of my most useful apps and would recommend it to other Android tablet users. I downloaded this from the Amazon App store, where it is free. ?
1,It's great. I would have recommend Facebook messenger for a safely reason or more than a safely reason, and no matter who's on Facebook that people can reach because some might not wanted anyone to know their 2 nd cell phone # for their own safely reason.
1,I don't know why people say this app doesn't work with Kindle because it is working fine for me. Their picture pops up and you click on it to get the message. The only annoying thing is the picture stays there when your done.
0,This app is really helpful so I know when I get my messages on facebook but does glitch often, which means I have to exit out of the app and go back in to it to read the message. Also chat bubbles DO NOT work. To add in, I do have to turn my internet off then back on to send messages once in a while. Overall I would say the benefits outweigh the negatives. Enjoy! (:
1,A lot of people people say it doesn't work for kindle IT DOES!!! This is what I use to text my friends from school and family that does not live in town well, I most definitely recommend this app it deserves more that 5 stars think about it, face time calling and texting and..... ITS FREEE!!!! It doesn't get much better than that definitely get this for facebook?????????????????????????
1,Great fun! I finally let myself download Facebook Messenger. And I'm very happy that I did. I had a lot of fun setting it up and putting my family and friends know that I had it. I'm sure that I will find lots of uses for it in the future.
1,A very useful tool to connect with friends.! The things you can do with it are cool! Like make group's and stuff
1,Messenger is the easiest and quickest way to contact anyone, whether by cel phone, computer or ipad. Messenger alerts you when a message is sent or received, and it doesn't matter what form of communication you are using.
0,messenger sucks. it uses way more power than any other app, notifications persist until the device is restarted, constantly interrupts other screen activities and updates more frequently than any other app ive seen. i only live with it because fb forced us into it. soon im probably just going to ditch the fb app altogether and use fb through browser.
1,I have been waiting for this to pop up on my kindle. I have no problems with it and the chat heads even work on my main screen. Works perfect on my kindle fire HDX- love it!
1,Recently in Ireland it would be difficult to stay in touch. My niece put this on our phones and it was in deed a communication lifesaver. My friends from the states that had it could also keep in touch. GREAT!!!!
0,Personally i love Facebook., So when I saw this app, I was happy. got it. That was about ten minutes ago...its still downloading. The sign that said it wasn't compatible with Kindle Fire didn't even pop up. I wish I never got this, because now my kindle is running very slowly just because it's still downloading and I can't stop it. Hope they Give us the no star option for reviewing, because that's what this app deserves. DON'T GET THIS APP IF YOU HAVE KINDLES!!!!
1,Most of you guys need to realize this isnt made by Facebook because it would not be called Facebook Messenger and instead Messenger. Facebook hasn't created any app for amazon as far as I know. Another thing most of these apps are made by someone who is nice enough to make an Amazon version so stop complaining and deal with what you have. Also it works just fine for me.
1,Don't see why everyone is complaining. It's a great app, runs smoothly. Let's you stay in touch with friends and family. To the contrary to what some people are saying, it's NOT a paid app. It's free. Honestly don't know why people are saying you need to buy it. Don't listen to them people. If you're on the fence, I'd say get the app if you are on Facebook & like being able to chat with friends and fam on there.
0,I find it much too pushy. I would rather have it use the standard notification functionality, in stead of these photo's that pop up on top of the current app, and that I have to keep dragging away all the time.
0,For some reason even tho amazon OS is directly based on android it's missing the latest update. I need to play that basketball game ASAP!! Why are you always weeks to months late with the update?
1,Don't believe the reviews that have 1 star, just because it didn't work on the Kindle Fire. I have a Kindle Fire, and it works great! I don't know what kind of Kindles they have, but I would give this app 10 stars.
0,I think it's really stupid you won't allow the owner of the account to log out of messenger. I know you have to spy on us lol but I just wanted to log my mom out so I can log in on her device. I had to uninstall the app completely, a real pain in the ass. That's taking things a little overboard by not making us stay logged in 24/7 lol. I doubt you will but please fix.
1,I do not have a data plan on my phone or even texting, this app was a God-sent since I was able to "talk" back and forth with my son, daughter in law and granddaughter who are in Verona, Italy right now (my native city) and I can tell them about different attractions in real time. I really really appreciate having this. Thank you.
0,It's supposed to be a quick way to message people but when I got it, the app kept freezing and my keyboard wouldn't work. I had to restart my kindle multiple times until I had enough and just deleted it. It is a good app on phones, as far as I've seen of course, but definitely not for a kindle.
0,Hi I was a satisfied customer but because of the update it will literally not load anything but the settings options this was my only way of communication I am so pissed off I have no way to talk to my loved ones now because they do not make there updates compatible with kindle fire anymore same with the actual Facebook app it does not work for kindle fire anymore please fix and hurry
1,I love messenger because you can video chat with friends and family that you haven't seen in a while.
1,Would like to be able to hear people calling me...I can see them only and can't figure out what to do
1,I got the app and it works great on Amazon kindles.its funny that this works. Not many other apps do.
1,Very nice to use and appreciate the easy way to have the ability to send a private/protected message.
1,Wished I didnt have to have a separate app to communicate with Facebook friends. But the app is fine.
1,It much does everything it should when it comes to Facebook Messanger. Works the same on all devices.
1,It is the Facebook Messenger app. It is good and integrates well with Facebook on Amazon Fire Tablet.
1,All the products I have bought on Amazon have been easy and fast delivery. Great quality no problems.
0,not liking the interruptions ... I live way out in the country & see no benefit for me personally ...
1,It's awesome it works perfectly as its supposed to............ I love it and my friends love it!!!!!!
1,Nobody ever told me I couldn't have this on my fire. It works great on both my 1st gen fire and my 5th gen. Never had a problem installing it.
1,Not sure what everyone is complaining about, I got it installed and working on my kindle fire hd just fine. Works just like my iPhone version.
1,It's OK. About the same as the regular Facebook instant messaging feature. But them, I don't use a cell phone for that use, so cannot comment.
1,This app is awesome and is compatible for the Amazon kindle fire. Make sure you are downloading properly... again this app works beautifully!!
0,When I get notified if I punch the notification button takes forever to load the message from there. Instead I open the app to see the message
1,free is always good. I can now call my long distance relative w/o being charge of international fees as long as they or I am connected to wifi
0,Sheesh. It always closes on me. It makes my whole phone run slower. I hate that it's becoming a requirement to have it when it barely works...
1,I'm happy to see that the app does indeed work on my kindle fire hd just how I'd expect it to work on any device I use for Facebook messenger.
0,Messenger used to work great. Now every time I get on I have to uninstall. Then I reinstall. That's the only way it works lately. Please fix.
1,It's so easy to use, like instant messaging. It's convenient especially when planning a function and everyone had it. I just created a group.

0,Messenger worked fine on my Fire HDX but thus mornings update took care of that. App has error loading and will not re-install. What's up with that?
0,I think it's good with my kindle fire hd... but then again it can be slow. I think some useless have a glitch therefore it doesn't work for everyone.
1,I am not a real faithful reader except when a book is really good, and this book was really good. Would recommend to anyone who likes a good mystery.
0,I found it annoying. Little faces pop up and you can't get rid of them...if you try it just opens the message. I preference to check mine manually.
1,Yay yay yay. Awesome app. One of my favorites love the sticker options and emojis. I don't have anything else to say but review is not long enough.
0,Only reason I am using the slow app is because Facebook is discontinuing xmpp support. Hopefully Jolla can find a way to have native facebook support
1,I love facebook it keeps connect to friends and family and found people I look for years and even found some nice men love facebook its a great thing
0,Calling and video NOT WORKING on my KINDLE FIRE HD, disappointed by you Facebook. Works just fine on my Galaxy S5. Please, please, please fix this!!
1,Messenger is a great texting app that doubles as your Facebook inbox. No need to be logged in to receive a message. Simple to use and well designed.
1,I like to use Facebook Messenger when I want to give or get personal information from a Facebook Friend. I am also notified when a message come in.
1,This works on my kindle fire HD perfectly. It is awesome!!!

1,This app works great for me it easy and help full I don't no why the other review say it's bad it works on my kindle fire HD

0,I really do not understand why to be on Facebook, you need to have two separate apps. It's inconvenient and drains my battery. Not to mention, your EXACT GPS location is sent to people you message. I brought this to the attention of Facebook and of course, they deny it, even though I did around five tests. So check your location sharing settings before messaging strangers.
1,Love this app. This is an app that I love having because I don't have to be logged into Facebook to get my messages. This app will keep your family and friends in touch with you even if you are not able to be online. This is one of them apps you cannot go without once you have it. Easy to download, no complications when using it, keeps you in touch with family and friends. This app is free and takes seconds to download.
1,Four stars for working ninety percent of the time. Nice for rural living since SMS won't send or be received. Crashes fairly infrequently. Pictures and videos usually send pretty quickly. Can now choose font colors which is both fun and a nice feature to prevent eye strain. Group chats are handy for communicating with family to arrange schedules, etc.
0,The app itself works pretty well. The only things I don't like is the fact that messenger won't update on my Amazon Fire Phone. Messenger tells me I can update it but when I go to the App Store it only gives me the option to open the app not upgrade it.
1,I've had trouble remembering the process to let me talk directing to my friends, Well Facebook Messenger pops up there face bubble and lets me talk in real time and it sits on my front screen! To Cool! Thanks for the App.
1,Runs a little glitchy on my Samsung Galaxy S3. I've had to uninstall and reinstall a couple times after its frozen up on my. Restart the phone and remove app and redownload seems to fix it for awhile. I love that it runs independently from the facebook app and pops up over other apps when you set that for notification choice I would improve how it runs but I cant live without it on my phone !
0,Really don't like that I need a separate app to view my FB messages and reply to them. Also the little bubble that stays on the screen can be annoying sometimes. Other than that it's an ok app, does what it's supposed to. But again, don't see why it's necessary when it could just be integrated into the FB app.
1,I know I am not alone when it comes to my addiction to keep in touch with my friends and family where ever we are. This messenger is wonderful with chatheads, that show a photo the user is using on their Facebook. I love that it also tells them that I am using mobile instead of being on my PC so they understand I might be driving and unable to reply right away. I like using this instead of text messaging because it keeps us updated and we can all be on the same chat window and stay on it always. Sharing photos and information safely and its saved for later on our PC.
0,This is a very annoying app. I just don't want to be that connected. I have tried to delete it 4 times and it won't go away. It makes noise. Ding ding and I can't shut it up!!! It shows pictures of my friends in places where I don't want to see them and I can't make them go away. I hate this app. I gave it a 1 star because I couldn't give it anything less. I do not recommend this app.
1,Let me just say that i delete my tango account since all the new updates. You can call, video chat or just chat with the facebook messenger. I was annoyed with tango because i was getting msg and calls from strangers, not anymore! Good job facebook, good job.

0,This app will not work with amazon kindle sorry. Gonna need to log on to Facebook and check your mailbox the old fashion way. Oh the horror!
1,After the negative reviews, I decided to try it anyway. It works well on my Fire and sure is easier than typing on that tiny phone keyboard.
0,Since I am online with my Kindle most of the time, this app keeps me informed as to which of my contacts are also online. I really like it!
1,I have a kindle fire and it works perfectly it's a good way to connect with family and friends they just made a video call which is helpful.
1,This app makes seding messages on Facebooks SO much easier and faster. I definitely recommend getting this if you use Facebook for messages.

1,This app is great. Helped chat with my friends without logging in to facebook. Helps me keep in touch with my friends immediately. Love it!!

0,This stupid thing don't work on kindle fire if you have a kindle fire do not get this app it just wants people to get this app and fool them
0,Takes up too much space, works as if it has a mind of it's own. Only gave 2 stars because it is handy when you don't have someone's number.
0,But, I'm passed about the lack of consideration that it has. It has up to the last update, but they are always 1 update behind. Freaking heck
0,From what I heard and read, this does NOT work on a kindle fire HD. So I don't exactly know what to say. So thanks. NOT!, if I don't like it.
0,Thought this might be fixed by now. Facebook use to work on Kindle Fire HD .... What happened with the upgrade and why is it not being fixed?
1,FB messenger is great. I wish there was an editing feature. But I like being able to switch between fb pages an nearly private conversations.
0,It's not compatible with my kindle fire , do you have to get a new kindle fire or it's just not available to all the people who have a kindle
0,I have deleted the App &so should you. It has way too much control over your personal information, location & even your webcam... NOT COOL!!!
1,A very nice product. One no need to struggling with it. It's user friendly. You can use it to call, send pictures, text as well as recording.
1,I keep reading all these opinions and don't understand. I've never had a problem on my Kindle Fire HD. It's always worked beautifully for me.
1,Go to setting except 3rd party apps the go to1 mobile apps it's safe the download th messenger app it works get on my kindle fire HDX 3rd gen

0,WHY DONT IT WORK !!!!!!!!!?!???!????!!!!!!!!$ I really hate the fact that it wont work . I'm really mad I need help .
0,I am forced to download this on my fire phone. It messes with other Facebook functions. I can't view videos. Terrible
0,Since the last update chat heads won't work and I can only read and respond to messages by going into the app itself.
1,Always a pleasure talking to my friends without having to download, delete, and post. NOw the gifs are even more fun.
1,Just called and talked to a cell phone from my kindle fire. Works great+just a little delay. Can't believe I did that
1,Ok, so I've been looking at the reviews and I'm soooo confused. I have a Kindle Fire HD 7 and it works great on mine!
1,It works on my kindle fire 2nd generation great! I love it and the pop up heads allow me to chat while on other apps!
1,Occasionally, even when I have Wi-Fi my message won't send. Other than that, it is a GREAT app!! It's worth getting!

1,Absolutely love this product. I use this extra battery instead of charging my phone. I find trying to open the cover to plug in my charger on my phone a pain. Its much easier for me to change the battery and my phone is always charged and ready to go. Well worth the money
0,There are better facebook chat clients than the official one. This one is bloated full of useless features and just eats up memory and space. I really wish they had kept the integrated facebook chat and hadn't forced people to download an extra client especially for those who have limited storage space.
1,I love this app all of my friends use everyon is talking about how great it is I just cant stop talking about how great I love this app if you see this I hope you download this app because it is amazing wow
1,With the new kindle is update Facebook messenger one runs chat heads smoothly which is a big plus for multi tasking
1,It does not have video calls; but I find Facebook Messenger to be very efficiant when I am messaging with more than one person. I also like that I can be reading an E-book, get a message, answer it, then, get back to reading my book by simply tapping on the profile picture bubble.
0,Pretty bummed about this app. Since I was obligated to download it. Well Facebook took the initiative in doing that. Since the last update my phone no longer plays videos on Facebook and freezes a lot more. Thanks Amazon Fire Phone!
0,it is compatible with a kindle fire! i tried it cause i usually hit sent from messenger when i am texting people and discovered that it is compatible with kindle fire... just thought i should share (: but the emojis get cut off and you cant use them :(
1,People were complaining that it wouldn't download for them. Recently, though, I have found that you can download it now. It is amazing! It is fun having this app to use to massage without going to the app.
0,I have removed this ap. I liked being able to play a game or read a book on my Kindle Fire and know when, and who, sent a private message. BUT the circular picture icon of who sent something, stayed on there, blocking my view, even if I choose "ignore." This WAS ANNOYING, however, still liked getting notifications, but ever since I downloaded, my Kindle kept freezing up and I had to shut it down and restart. Sometimes three times a day! I had to remove it...and my Kindle is fine. Too bad it was buggy. I may try again later, hopefully it is improved.
1,Glad that it was recommended to me, now I can get my messages as they come in instead of constantly checking them. I enjoy having the little bell tone that lets me know when a message comes in when I am doing something else .

1,Awesome, I talk to my grand children.
1,Quick, easy, love the camera function.
1,Good app... a must for Facebook users.
0,As soon as I installed it, my tablet started behaving weird. Like it had a virus. The screen would freeze, & it wouldn't let me go onto other apps. I finally removed from my device & the tablet behaved normally.
0,I love having Facebook messenger on my kindle but the only thing is I cannot log out. That prevents privacy from people you don't want reading your conversations. So if you don't want people reading your personal convo's don't download this app until they put a log out on it.
1,I am using it on my Kindle fire HD and it works great. I see a lot of the fuss about it not being compatible with the original Kindle fire, but you must realize that by now, those are considered outdated. It takes way too much time and effort to make things for old and outdated technology. Same reason people no longer build programs for Windows 95, or XP...
1,This app is amazing for the KFHD idk why people hate on this app so much. But back to the point, this app is among especially when you don't have a cell phone and all you have is WIFI and nothing else
0,Can't see any messages, it says there's an error and to try reloading. Changing tabs crashes the app.essage bubbles hide behind the navigation bar. Numerous other problems. No response from facebook on any feedback.
1,Perfect companion to Facebook!
1,I wish I can download this app
0,I no how to ?heck the settings to my preference but still doesn't notify me in any way or form when I get a message.. I did every setting I could find on fb.. the app itself.. and the kindle itself.. all settings.. and it doesn't work!! wtff how do I fix this? ??? no chat heads pop up.. no noise.. even when idle..
0,It's a damn nuisance. It keeps blocking the right side of the screen, and it performs no function other than taking a feature that worked nicely in the facebook app and putting it in a different (and worse) app.
1,I use this each and every day to keep in touch with my family and friends. My four teenagers may not always get my text messages or so they claim but they always receive my Facebook messages.
0,Won't even load up on brand new Amazon Fire.
1,This app has provided me hours of enjoyment.
1,Easier than going into FB to send a message.

1,Very reliable when it come it getting your messages
1,love messenger i get to keep in touch with everyone
1,so happy with this.i can talk on my fire Kindle now
0,Not crazy about this at all and will be deleting it
1,This app works fast and hardly ever crashes. Kudos!
1,When you don't have texting and you need to send a message to someone this works and is GREAT.
1,I just can't seem to get rid of the little pop up at times , or this would have been 5 stars !
1,All your Facebook friends in one place which makes it easy to see who is online and who isn't.
1,It works well when you want to send a more private message to one of your friends on facebook.
0,There is a bug. Continually the app stay frozen, so you need to close the app and relaunch it.
0,App does not work fine on my Fire phone! It does not open the Chat Heads and it crashes a lot!
1,Nice to be able to chat without logging on to Facebook! And the phone-calling is a real bonus!
0,Not a fan of messenger. I hate that you can't send normal messages through Facebook any more!
0,This app worked for a while but it really needs an update. It keeps freezing on my fire phone.
1,Works fine on Fire 7. Facebook seems to think you need a update to the program consistently.
1,I like Facebook Messenger so far. I can comucate with my friends faster without going to the Facebook app. You can have several conversation going at one time. Great APP !!
1,Enjoying it very much.
0,Not really sure what this feature does since someone "called" me according to my FB email but I have no idea where the call went or how I would "answer" it.
1,As of today's date, Facebook Messenger works just fine on the 1st Gen. KFHD (firmware: 7.5.1). It's no Line, but since Amazon App Store doesn't have Line - This is alright.
0,It works fine on my Kindle Fire. However I gave it 1 star since I see no reason why facebook needs a separate messenger app when the one within FB seemed to work just fine.
1,Great easy way to get Facebook messages in one easy step. I usually never remembered to check if I had any messages but now I don't miss them because of this separate app
0,I downloaded it and then it froze. I deleted it because it was kicking me off every time I tried to enter. I uninstalled it and then tried reinstall it but it doesn't work
0,I like this app because it allows me to chat with friends without javing to pay or sign up for some stupid account that u have to put in ur phone plan and all of that crap
0,I downloaded this for my Kindle & it just plain & simple won't work -- not worth the effort or the time to try to fix. I'll just message on my home PC -- much easier......
1,I read a lot of reviews saying they couldn't use this on their kindle fire. I always try for myself, so I downloaded the app and am not having any difficulty. Just an fyi.
1,Works great on my Kindle Fire. Haven't had any problems!
1,Awesome speed to recive messages. Love it way go FB! :)
1,Works great and I am still using first edition of kindle
1,It had good features of sending photos. And attachments.
0,I don't like it. It was just fine as a part of Facebook.
1,Loved having face-time with my daughter, & gradkiddo's!
1,Great way to stay in touch. Love the video chat option!
0,Hard to move around in. Made two calls without trying.
1,Didn't know it existed, so am now very pleased with it.
1,Messenger is a great way to get or send a message fast.
0,I use this app all the time on other devices and it works perfectly fine. On my kindle fire HD it crashes pretty often and will not connect. When it works it works great, but I have it two starts because of how often this app crashes
1,its about time they put this app in stores ive been waiting forever. i really like the app. the only thing you shouldnt do is update. NEVER update or it wont work, but other than that it works great!!!
0,The video calling doesn't work.
0,So basically it's worthless.
0,I hate this app! I just deleted it. It puts little floating heads all over my device that don't go away unless you shut your whole device down. Also, there's no way to turn this app off. Annoying AF!
1,Still checking it out, so far I like it. It's pretty good and have reestablished contact with all my Facebook friends. Can't wait to put five star's on it. Love you Amazon. Charles Davidson and Gizmo
1,This app is great. I talk to my friend on it most of the day. It tells you when people are available to talk and if they have read your text. Great app. Get it but it has to be linked with facebook.
0,This app use to be great at first but now useless every time I use it my calls get disconnect or dropped sometimes the other person can't hear me and there is always noise, always a connection issue
1,I love Facebook Messenger. I used to use Facetime until some in my family no longer had iphones. Skype is a pain and seems to drag. Facebook Messenger works great for my family with no problems.
0,It was fine...UNTIL i loaded an update!!! Crashed!!! Might try reloading cuz its gr8 when it works...Loaded into the new 7" Fire tablet. Dont know if the problem was messenger, or the tablet???
0,Just today I updated this, and no longer works...EPIC FAIL Facebook! This will remain a one star until this works on kindle fire! I am beyond upset with this...I should NEVER have updated this, cause it was working perfectly before this...Thanks loads Facebook!
0,So I download messenger and cannot use it. Says it needs an update. Then why isn't the updAted version in the app store? Because now in order to download it I have to remove my security because the update is not from the app store? Got a kindle. Also cannot watch videos with the newest Facebook. What is going on. Do ya even test this stuff before u put it out there?
1,I cant do videocall yet why???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1,This is THE most valuable application on my cell phone. My son is in a part of the world where it is very expensive to have a cell phone. He does have Internet Service. This application allows us to send messages (Like Text Messages) or we can actually place a call across the service. It is a HUGE POSITIVE!!! (A++++++)
0,Since getting my new fire phone I have downloaded Messenger a few different times because the pop out chat heads did not work properly. It still won't work like it should, and if I try to click on the message in my notification bar it will freeze my phone. I have had good experiences in the past with other devices, but compatibility with devices such as mine needs to be considered.
0,I'm not sure how I feel about it because I am not very technical. Therefore, it's hard for me to know what it includes. I wish it had Minions Characteristics so that I could add different pictures for different reasons. It is very nice to be able to see that some one has sent me a Private Message without having to be on FB .I really like that feature so far.
1,All of you people saying it doesn't work with Kindle fire, maybe you should try again, because it works fantastically on my kindle fire hd. So if you are going to comment about it not working how about trying again first.
1,It's better than the Instagram for Kindle Fire. I don't see a problem, it never shuts off or however you guys are putting it.. I guess the only con is if you want to log into another account, you have to reinstall it.
0,Messenger has been promoting for an update for the past couple of weeks. But when I attempt to do so there is no update available in the Amazon Appstore. Either provide the update or eliminate the prompt.
1,Ok , so everyone is saying that the messenger app does not work with kindle fire, but I have a kindle fire and it works perfectly. I was reading some of the reviews and I almost didn't get it but I got it anyway to see if it worked. It took awhile to load, but then it worked perfectly. Can someone please tell me why mine is the only kindle fire that works with it, or did you fix it?
1,Easy to use
1,Works great
1,It would be nice is they would allow the newer updates for the Kindle Fire HD6 :/
1,works well
1,Great app!
1,Good game.
1,Great game
1,Works goid
1,Very nice.
1,Works well
0,I'm only posting this on the Facebook messenger one so lots can see. Your entire system I would rate zero stars if possible. Every other time I open an app it will say it's not responding, Facebook messenger is the worst one, fix your entire system.
0,I do not like it and feel forced. I'll get it to use my ap then when a bubble alerts me of an incoming message my phone freezes up. So I delete it and now I just use the fb page through the browser to check my messages not the ap to avoid messenger
1,Truely faster and complete notifications.
0,I clicked on messenger and made a call and could barely hear the person I called. Then a photo appeared on my screen in a white circle. Of someone I do not know. I stopped notifications of this person but the white circle is still floating around on my screen.
0,I've had constant problems using this on my Fire phone. It keeps saying session expired and makes you log out. I see other reviews where you can't use it with other Kindle products. Is there a reason for this?
1,This app is better than fb by far
1,facebook messenger is an awesome way to commiunicate
1,I appreciate being able to communicate.
1,I have been listening to BBN for the past 13 years way down here in Barbados. It gives me a good boost during my day. I really enjoy, the music, preaching and all the other programming as well. May God Bless you and keep you to continue your work.
1,Anyone who thinks this app isn't good isn't using it right. This is so useful because it runs much faster then the messaging on the Facebook app so I can talk to my family and friends a lot more easily.
1,Love da opportunity 2 call my friendz or video chat..!
1,Nice to have face to face chats better then just phone
0,I enjoy talking to my Grandchildren in other states
0,Just installed and getting a blank screen. Please fix.
1,It' actually pretty good. And it's pretty fun as well.
1,It has crappy grafics but aside from that it very good
0,Not compatible with the Kindle Fire HD. Very annoying.
0,Why isn't this compatible with the Amazon/Kindle Fire?
0,Only ok because I don't like how obtrusive the app is.
1,eh its a messenger program what more do you expect LOL

1,excelent
1,the best
1,Easy use
1,I like the convenience of the app,but it really leaves your personal info. Out there if you don't take precautions. Overall, it's the best we have for now.
0,It is far too intrusive as far as your personal privacy is concerned. And there is no way to log out...one must go to the app manager and force it to quit.
0,When using this app the fire phone would lock up and, I'm not sure what the compatibility issues. Therefore easiest solution was to remove app. Frustrating.
1,I like games that don't require much thought, this game gives clear quests, and manages to be true to characters, that were like family when was growing up.
0,DO NOT GET WITH A FIRE PHONE THE SIDE CHAT ON YOUR SCREEN WILL NOT WORK INLESS YOU ARE IN A CALL. AND IT WILL NOT LET YOU OPEN THE CHAT IN THE FACEBOOK APP.
0,Necessary evil but I wish they had simply left their messaging portal inside the Facebook platform. All Facebook is doing is needlessly eating up my memory.
1,messengere is good because he give many solution to propel in the world. science is the best method for technologies and this is humanity thank you for all
0,It works fine if you don't update it so disable automatic update and you can use this but I give 3 stars for the incompatibility with the latest version...
0,Very bad. I just installed it on my Kindle Fire HD 1st G. but the app crash when I try to make phone calls. Not only the app, the Kindle restart sometimes.
1,Easy set up. Great for in depth conversations. I love the ability to record a voice message. One minute messages back and forth saves tons of time typing.
1,I did received my ultimate digestive enzymes on time. It helps break down my food that is not digested. Good product to have for gas & bloating.
0,I'm sure it does what it's supposed to do - but I didn't like it and deleted it pretty much right away. Facebook is intrusive enough on its own!
1,this is awesome love it & i absolutely love all the stickers u can buy & have. just wish the chat heads would pop up on my kindle 7 fire
1,love that I can get a hold of someone faster than an email and they can still get back to me when they can. But I know that they got the message
0,Ready the terms. They can turn on your camera on your phone and take pictures and search your location among other things and I don't like that.
1,I had the Facebook app for my Kindle, and only recently realized I needed a separate app for Facebook Messenger. Works seamlessly with Facebook.
1,Not sure If other kindle users are on newest update or not but can confirm this and the Giphy app work fine for me. Newest fire hd 7 on 4.5.5 is
1,Enjoy using it with my family and friends!!! Nice fun way to stay in touch with everyone. Lots of Emoticons to play with, even animated ones :)
0,If Spanish language option was available for kindle Fire that would eliminate the need for so many misspellings....other than that it's alright
1,Um i don't know why all these stupid are saying it don't work for kindle Amazon he. I have one and it works for it so. It's a good app. No lags
1,Love it, it's so easy to use
0,FACE BOOK SUCKS ALL TOGETHER
1,who texts or skypes anymore?
1,Good quality and easy to use
1,It is an app. All I can say.
1,Love this app a lot's of fun
0,I do not know how to use it.
1,Thanks for the free service.
1,It works on my kindle fire!!
0,App would not install on S5.
0,This app was just way to intrusive. I couldn't use my Kindle because I kept getting facebook bubbles. At least it was easy to remove.
1,Very interesting but can't understand the other party when I call. On Face talk the picture is great but can't hear the person at all.
1,The Messenger app is fantastic for use with facebook and keeping in touch with friends and family. It's great to have it on my Kindle.
1,The one star reviews arent true! Im not kidding! It doe work on kindle fire! Works GREAT on kindle fire! Facebook has done a great job!
1,The app itself works fine yet so did the old Facebook app that had messenger built in, otherwise its just another app to take up memory
1,It's a good app, I have it on my iPod. But it's stupid that it shows up on the Kindle app store if it isn't compatible with the Kindle!
0,When someone call my I can't hear the ring. But if someone text me everything is perfect, I can hear the notification in all my house.
0,Difficult using the keypad for this app. Also the spell check and predictive text are not as good as they could be. Better on my iPad.
1,This little guy is awesome for connecting wth friends and family and sharing info. You do not have to be on facebook to use it either.
1,Well, It's been acting up over the past two days. I re-downloaded it and it STILL isn't working right. Please fix. ~ Kindle Fire user.
0,It is very sluggish on my Kindle Fire HD
1,Wouldn't know what I would do without it
1,Keeps me connected while playing games,!
1,Easy..concise...not for long dialogues..
0,It sucks bad!! I took it off of my phone
1,It's nice knowing when I have a message.
0,I couldn't install due to Trojan virus.
1,Good app you see your message right away
1,????????????????????
0,This has not showed up yet on my kindle!
1,This is very convenient. You don't have to get into Facebook to see your private messages. It eliminates a lot of hassle.
0,This app repeated &#34;Install Pending&#34; every time I tried to download & install it!!!! It never worked!!!!
1,This works really well on my Kindle Fire, a few glitches here and there but I find it very resourceful and quite helpful :)
1,Worked as intended. There is nothing much to expect, just the FB app for your Kindle, the same you have at your Smartphone.
0,Slow and glitches out my kindle. Really really sad. Don't waste your time downloading this...it worked for maybe 10 seconds
1,Facebook is Facebook. Love it, spend too much time on it, but it is helping me stay in touch with my family and I love it.
1,Handy and you will already be accustomed to it if you have used facebook. I find it useful for quick questions to friends.
1,Everyone is on Facebook 24/7. I can contact anyone with messenger... I think I use it more than my "phone" itself.
0,it does not let me download. what an outrage it really sucks! !!!!! don't let me download. and apperently no one else
1,It works pretty well but crashes at odd moments. Still a few bugs need to be fixed before l can give FB Messenger 5 stars.
0,An upgrade for me. Works as expected...
1,Excellent tragic also heartwarming read
1,It works for my kindle fire just fine??
1,Works good on my old Kindle Fire tablet
1,Works great but it needs more bug fixes
1,Worked the first time I used it. Neat.
1,love this application. it works great..
0,It does not work on Kindle Fire and I am giving it only one star because Amazon should have another app that says Facebook Messenger for Kindle which will help to avoid needless downloads.
0,I hate you have to join to use. Then allow Facebook to snoop into your business. Wish I hadn't gotten hooked on Facebook. Now there's messenger which didn't need because we had texting.
1,I used my kindle fire an it works find

1,Good app.
1,Very good
1,im still getting used to it but i like it good app I use it when i dont wanna go on facebook i just wanna chat to my family
0,Clear connection. Voice echoes through the whole call, so is hard to maintain a conversation without interrupting the other person at the end of the other line. Calls dropped to much when not having a good connection.
0,Thanks Facebook, for causing Kindle Fire HD owners to NOT be able to use Facebook messaging until the unforeseeable future. I am growing to dislike Facebook more and more for their lack of consideration. FYI, it's not amazon's fault that Facebook isn't creating an app that's compatible with Kindle users.
1,This app is great and much easier to use than accessing your messages from the actual desktop version of Facebook. I do not like the "other" folders or that you cannot see your messages that are from people not on your friends list. I also use the call function that is available through the app quite often to chat with friends overseas in other countries for free, however the call quality is not always that great.
1,Kindle Fire users stop acting like babies. I am sure most if not all of you have smart phones and pc/Mac. Use those. Facebook will eventually get this working on your tablets if demand merits the upgrade.
0,I really loved this app until the last 2 updates. I liked that I didn't have to be logged into FB to msg. But the last updates make it impossible to use as a stand alone. I sent complaint to developers
1,I've only used the app a handful of times and I'm learning as I go. I like having the option of texting or making a phone call with the option of seeing the person you're talking to. Kind of like skype, but simpler.
1,I have this app on my Amazon Fire 7 and my phone. When my tablet is not on, my phone lets me know my granddaughter is looking for me. Just that in itself, makes this app priceless. I can then turn on my tablet and Skype her beautiful self.
0,So far only used it a couple of times, pretty nice so far, the only thing , the messenger/ friends picture stays up on the screen ,after you have finished with your message, couldn't,seem to get rid of it!
0,After the little circle of friends that appear on the screen. Can't get rid of it. How do I do that, without turning off my tablet? Pain in the butt to get it off my screen. Even after leaving a message and looking at message.
0,Works well but does not connect directly to facebook app, have to go into messenger directly.
0,won't go away after your done. gets in the way of doing other things on your tablet or phone.
1,Its great to have personal thoughts be just that personal between myself and one other person
1,It great I love it l, people can get in touch with me as much as I cam get in touch with them
1,I find messenger very reliable for me,to communicate with all my family &friends...thank you!
1,like this very much and even make phone call on it to the person that also has it and a phone
0,The app opens, that's all it does correctly. I don't get any of my messages or notifications.
1,I love this app. Easy to use, my only complaint is that i takes up storage on my amazon fire.
0,Can't get to some of my pictures can't find any thing I want not sure if it's as good pop up
1,I am on kindle fire amazon and I go this app but didn't hit open I went to home and it did it
1,I got the fire phone so I'm good haha and I love it
0,Will not work on Kindle Fire. Big waste of time. .

1,It is great because I get to message very one I love and know.
1,About time we came up with an easier private messenger for FB.

1,Much easier and handier than going on the website all the time
1,I don't have any problems with it... I love the new sounds lol

1,Just downloaded this on my fire hd. It doownloadedine and can see all my messages. Silly latest Facebook update took messenger away so I had to download this. Was worried after I read all the reviews saying it was not kindle capable as many popular apps aren't sadly. Perhaps they were listened to and they fixed it.
1,I was just sent a upate and figured i make a review. I just read a handful here and don't understand first of all why this app doesn't have a 5 star rating? It is AWESOME!!! I use my Kindle fire wth it and have NEVER had one problem with this app. A couple of the great things about it are you don't have to waste time going into Facebook each time you want t message. Just click the app and you can see all your friends Also, it alerts me each time a get a message. I message with ir quite a bit because of it being secure. Sometimes with multiple people. If i had to keep switch back and forth from each person or if i am playing a game at the same time as messageing and go back to Fb and the msg part. I wouldn't be msging people nearly as much. I have had my Kindle (Which is AWESOME) for just about a year and a half now and never had a problem with it or this app. If there are people that are having trouble with this app. I think it very well be your device.
1,Fantastic for phones, now our favorite multimedia messaging app; on older Kindles the image-sending function may be impeded, and you can workaround starting from your device "Photos" collection if the chathead is opened.
0,I have a Kindle Fire Hdx 8.9". Takes up allot of cache memory, need to constantly run a 3rd party cleaner to get rid of the left over files this messenger leaves after each use. Functionality is decent. UI is o.k
0,This app is extremely buggy due to the fact that this app is set to run above other programs as well which works excellent on normal android phones but operates poorly on the fire OS. Amazon needs to fix this bug.
1,I love Face Book Messenger. I have had it on my phone for over a year now. Then I saw that I could download it to my Kindle and did immediately. I love all the characters that are on Messenger. I love the app. It is a lot of fun to chat with family or friends and use the different characters.
1,They need a link button to return to the Facebook webpage. I will send a message then have to close it and reopen the Facebook app to view timeline or anything on fb other than chat. No major problems with the app other than that.
0,I love my kindle fire HDX. I don't love using Facebook on it. Videos don't work most of the time, if they do they don't have sound. All in all I have been rather disappointed with the programming for various releases of this app.
0,This has been very buggy on my Fire phone. The alerts aren't popping up, so if I miss the initial sound, I don't see anything unless I keep going in the app to check it. Please fix this!
1,Facebook Messenger is a must have app if you have an active Facebook account. It allows you to easily keep in communication with other FB friends if they have Facebook Messenger. Keeps things fairly private and communicates efficiently. Worthwhile having!
0,Only u this one time so far.
1,Very pleased with Messenger.
0,Didn't work on the Kindle...

0,Very annoying
0,In laymen's terms; simply terrible. App constantly crashes as well as the Facebook app when you TRY to swipe to messages. Google play is far superior. Regretting buying Amazon products.
0,Messenger and Facebook work ok on Fire phone, with the exception of notifications. I'm still getting audible notifications, but no visual or chat heads. Is this working for anyone else?
0,Never actually used it to connect with anyone after I installed it. The messenger icon stayed on my screen and got in my way when using other apps, so I uninstalled it before using it.
0,why advertise this for the customers that have the kindle fire / kindle fire HD if you know dang well we can't. use this? Fix the issue and maybe ALL of us just might change our minds!
1,This song has special meaning to me and she knows who she really is .. dontcha? cept we didn't marry and I regret that and I think our version would have ended differently pretty sure
0,Hate it and everything about it, especially the floating bubble pictures that get in the way of sering my screen. I have seriously considered dumping FB over this obnoxious intrusion.
0,Usually it worked fine on this Kindle fire but today I am having an issue where I can't go down the newsfeed without it shutting down. Same happens on my timeline. Not a happy person.
1,I'm a senior citizen & fairly new to this device but luckily I have friends & family who are very knowledgeable & patient with me. I just learned how to download this app & I LOVE it.
0,THE WHOLE THING IS NOW STUCK ON MY DEVICE I CANT DELETE OR NOTHING!!!!
1,This app is great. It works seamlessly w/ Facebook. It is especially useful for those conversations you don't want to have in public because they are either too long or too personal.

1,Not bad at all
0,Sent voicemails worked for about a week then quit playing . I noticed Kindle did an update at about that time so I'm not sure who is at fault but since voice messaging was my main reason for getting this app, I'm only giving it two stars. Please fix.
1,When you have the Facebook app you got To have the messenger app that's what they want otherwise you can't get your messages or send messages unless you login directly to Facebook through the Internet that has been my experience
1,Really like to use Messenger when I want to converse with someone privately.
1,Didn't try out previously did to reviews saying it didn't work on kindle. After installing on my new phone, I decided to give it a try. It downloaded, installed, and set up just fine and seems to be working just as it should. No issues so far with it working on fire kdx.
1,i enjoy being able to chat with friends I did not give five stars because it sometimes shuts down
1,I use this app in my Kindle Fire HDX. Works fine. No problems. The reviews said it wouldn't work for my kindle, but I noticed those reviews were OLD, so I gave it shot. I'm guessing they fixed whatever was causing it not to work because I don't have any issues with it. It's very easy to install and use. I recommend it.
1,Since facebook made it impossible to use messanger thru the facebook app itself and forced people to either do without and not get messages or download the app I have gotten pretty use to us. It works pretty good ut does crash sometimes. Seems to be buggy sometimes. Hopefully they will finally get it right one of these days.
1,I rarely have any trouble with this app. Occasionally it indicates that I have new messages, when I've actually already read them. But that doesn't happen often, and it's only a minor annoyance. This app makes it easy to stay in touch with family and friends on Facebook. And I love the big selection of stickers, they're so cute.
1,I don't know what you guys are talking about. The app works just fine for me. It is a good way to talk to your friends without having to go on and off over and over. You should get it
1,Hey guys those who are unable to get it for your kindle..I have it...I have a kindle fire hd 3gen ...just download from a android market and sync and it will show up install in the market...then just delete the unofficial one and download the app store messenger...cheers

1,Very good communication tool. Thanks for this website.
1,I had good luck with this. I was very pleased with it
0,Facebook messenger seems to have a few bugs. It slows everything down and takes up room. It's a Facebook thing because I have heard it had the same issues on an android
1,It's great better then first one you hear from people faster they let you know you have a message right away you will hear a bell. I highly recommend it for all ages.
1,Video chat via messenger is so much better than Skype. Clear picture and audio. I have only recently been invited to join messenger. Don't know how I lived without it.
0,I love facebook, but hate that to see private messages I was forced to get the app. Wish they had left the system alone and added the app just for those who wanted it.
1,Clean fast app that relays messages FROM Facebook, without the necessity of a large screen. Thank you. Now they still need a Take this off my screen and wall button.
1,There are times when I prefer to have just the messenger instead of the complete facebook app. Works really well on my BlackBerry Z10. Thanks to Amazon and BlackBerry.
1,I luv this app it is so much faster than regular facebook thank u for making this wonderful app I luv how it notifies me when someone messages me thank u for making it
1,With Prime service is great. Only had 1 return out 60 plus ordered. Wife gets upset because I'm ordering all the time. When you can save a buck go for it. Just saying.

1,Signed up do to other friends and I love it!
0,I dont like that facebook messenger automatically shows your personal information to everyone no matter what your facebook settings are set at.
0,I HATE having to have a separate app to get Facebook messages. It's idiotic. I wish FB would drop this and put the messages back on the FB app.
0,The face of the last person that message me gets stack on the screen and it is impossible to get rid off. I want to know how to delete this app
1,Love that I can use the Facebook messenger disengaged from my Facebook program. Its a text like program, that floats on our smart phone screen.
1,Love the fact that I don't have to open Facebook to receive notification. The person's picture is right on my front page when I open my Kindle.
1,It's finally for kindle fire! Thank you! I love it. Only problem is the chat heads aren't coming up, and when I try, it makes my kindle freeze.
0,Installed on my Kindle fire, didn't work. Tried again, still didn't work. Not sure where the issue was, didn't care enough to try to find out.
0,Difficult to get back to previous pages. Could just be a glitch with my phone. I uninstalled it and only have the Facebook app installed now.

0,Talk about sharing your soul to the Government
1,Very easy to use and find what I'm looking for
0,I Can't get Through the First Step. Please Fix
1,I don't know why this app gets so much hate. It is the best and most thoughtfully-designed messaging app for the kindle, period. If you know anything about development you can tell they must have spent a lot of money making this app as integrated and functional as it is.
1,Even tho the reviews said it didn't work on Kindle Fire, I went ahead and downloaded, anyway. As soon as the app was downloaded there was an update to do before I could open the app. I have a Kindle Fire HD and this apps works exactly like the one on my phone!! I kind of stink at texting so being able to do this on my KFHD, at home, works out REALLY well for me! The bigger keyboard is exactly what I need to get my messages out quickly without having to constantly go back and fix my errors, spelling or otherwise. Also LOVE the fact that I can now use the same stickers as I have on my phone. Using FB thru my KFHD, I was not able to use the stickers bcause it is only available thru the FB messenger app!!!
1,I got it for my kindle fire hd. Works great :) the other reviews said it would not work...So am glad I took the chance to see for myself. I did not use a phone number of course and works from the get go :)
1,I love it j can talk to my friends and family and I don't have to click kn the facebook Icon no more when I would hit it I would have to punshmh email and password and that was crazy I didn't like that but know I got messenger and I is sk easy and fast
1,I think it's a awesome app and works really well in my kindle ! I suppose you to download it
1,Really works great for kindle fire hd.
1,it is easy. Now, I can chat with my relative instant. Thank you
0,Bugs: -can't open Messager from from Facebook -can't search images -crashes offen -missing settings -crashes when the other person send a keyboard gif Other than these bugs, it works fine
0,The chat works fine, but it's not letting me attach photos or send emojis or the cute stickers????? I'm using my Kindle Fire. Please fix this because I don't have space on my iPhone for this stupid app. I'm only using it so I can message my girlfriend. Thank you.
0,It is not a bad app, it is just that while iOS and Android get updated versions, on Fire Phones keeps the same. I mean, it would be cool if I can change the color just like the other versions, right? Another complain I have is when some of my friends send me a .gif, the app just crashes and I am unable to see further content until they send me something else.
1,Must have. I can have 2 things on, computer & kindle. + my phone, all made a chiming notice.
1,I love that on my Kindle, I can use Facebook Messenger to call one of my contacts thru WiFi.
0,It does not work with the kindle fire. it does nothing more than come up a blank white page
1,This allows me to talk to my sister and her family, who live so far away from me. Thank you.
1,Why'd facebook even separate messenger from their actual app. Oh well, it is useful though.
0,It works but when someone's try to call u u can't talk and it drops the call even with WiFi
0,This app is terrible. Do not download. Piece of shot. Doesn't work right and slows my phone.
1,Great way to communicate with friends and family without the rest of the FB world seeing it.
1,I personally enjoy this because, it is an easy way to talk to people with out wasting time.
1,Love playing. This game. Wins more money than most slots , has different way to win. Wanda
1,Messenger is amazing app, wouldn't change a thing.
1,It is ok just don't like it to much will keep it .
1,Great for keeping in touch with friends and family
1,This the perfect place to talk mess with my homies
1,Great for private conversation and family sharing.
0,Needs a sing out button so you can switch accounts
1,Not much to say apart from the fact that it works.
1,I like messenger,because it is a good way to talk.
1,It's a faster way to talk to ur friends and family
1,Work perfectly! Shipped fast!!! Highly recommend .
0,First of all, I can't believe I'm defending Facebook for anything. Second of all, the people who blame Facebook for Messenger not working on their Kindle Fire are mostly just ignorant. The Kindle Fire has 4% or less of the market, and uses FireOS, NOT the standard Android OS. THIS is why apps break on the Fire, guys. And how many developers do you think REALLY want to do something extra for people too cheap to buy a &#34;real device&#34;? (This is how it comes across to many developers) Third, Facebook Messenger is FREE. People who demand things this way for a free app are extremely selfish and entitled individuals. SOLUTION: Get some fresh air. Do something actually with friends and family, instead of relying upon a free app. Gain some healthy perspective. Stop acting as if Facebook is &#34;violating&#34; some right, because their app doesn't work on your crappy Amazon tablet. And if you want to yell at someone, then yell at AMAZON, because their tablet doesn't work with a lot of the apps which work just fine on everything else! (And, I'm betting you actually PAID for that Amazon tablet, correct???)
0,Literally stops working any time I sign out of my Facebook on my phone. I can't exit out of it I have to uninstall and re install again. Ridiculous. I don't even want to use chat anymore. bulls*** we are required to use it..
0,Amazing when application actually works, was forced to delete the application when it would frequently not respond. This would happen when the application was not in use, and my phone thought it necessary to notify me at all times.
1,I don't understand why this can't be implemented into the normal facebook app. It's amazing, but can't they just make it into an update to the normal facebook app? Anyway, it worked perfectly and I haven't experienced any problems. Would be five if it wasn't a separate app
0,I am not particularly fond of it. I liked being able to send messages from my Facebook account which I can still do on my laptop, but not my tablet. The only reason I got it was so I could send messages to my Facebook friends from my tablet.
1,This app saves me a lot of money. I use facebook messenger instead of texting as long as the person has facebook. I use this to stay in touch with my husband while we are both at work. I works great and I love all the features that it has and that all my facebook conversations are at the same place. I only use the app for my Facebook messaging nothing else so I can't say anything about all the features that it has. I recommend this to anyone who uses Facebook and wants to be able to stay in touch with their friends and family on the go. My husband has an unlimited data package on his phone so he uses this to get in touch me. I on the other hand have limited data so I use this when I have free wifi access. Why pay for text messaging if you don't have to.
1,Having trouble opening 4 pics 1 Word and sharing it with a friend on my Kindle.Need help.Other than that it is a great and easy program to use because of its ready to use icons that show up on your screen.
0,Ok well um it worked for my kindle for almost a month and then it stopped working so it sucks now because I cant delete it off my kindle it wont work o.o im serious I tried and it also stopped working like wow so I cant access it either and it wont delete off my systom period like wtf? So kindle fire users do not get this application cx
1,the previously broke messanger app... NOW WORKS WITH KINDLE FIRE. Rejoice. its runs smoother than the texting function from the facebook app, but still has a ways to go. all in all, a decent app.
0,If you have a kindle fire, and you successfully have installed Facebook messenger to your device, DO NOT UPDATE THE APP, IT WILL NO LONGER WORK. I just learned this from experience and I no longer have messenger because it wouldn't respond so I deleted it.
1,very cool way to talk to your friends
1,The app works well and is easy to use
1,Perfect for anyone who uses Facebook.
0,Need a solid update.. bcoz too bad...
0,why the hell do i have to install dis
0,it was ok but not good for my tablet.
0,Big Brother must have developed this.
0,Do not like messages posted on e Mali
0,Why is there an instagrahm screenshot
1,ALWAYS VERY HELPFUL IN ALL SITUATIONS
0,It keeps crashing so I have to keep downloading over and over its annoying and I'm tired of it. Fix this app. If I'm being forced to use it I want it to work. Btw this isn't Amazon's fault. It's Facebook's.
0,OK.....wish that the other messages would actually show up. If someone is messaging you from a group that you are both a part of that message should not go into your "others" folder
0,When the app actually works properly it's great! But sometimes it will act up and I'll have to either turn my kindle fire on and off again, or re-download the app. It's really annoying when this happens, and it happens more frequently than it should.
1,I have the kindle fire hd. It's the 7&#34; screen with ads. It works perfectly fine and I've never had any problems with it whatsoever. I promise it works. At least for me. I don't know why it wouldn't work for anyone else, I guess it's just weird like that.
1,The app works great on kindle fire. My only complaint is you can not search facebook but works great if you don't have facebook. People can find you and you can find them if they have Facebook. I got it to talk to my friends then I got Facebook, when my mom let me. I give it 5 stars.
0,I used to be able to search through bing for images to be added to my message using my Kindle Fire. I reported it umpteen times and have gotten no reply!! This issue still continues . I'm completely frustrated because I love this added feature!!! Obviously reporting a problem goes to nowhere because no one seems to be able to reply or to fix this issue!! It's been months! Anyone else have this problem??
0,this is rediculouse its not working yesterday it was today its acting all weord messages keep spinning and not loading amd.it keeps disconnection and reconnecting like wtf its pissing me of FIX IT NOW
0,I bought the new 2015 Fire tablet in December. I can only use this app for one or two days on my tablet. After that it won't open. I then have to uninstall then reinstall it. I am using the Amazon app store to get Messenger so I don't understand what the problem could be. Anyone else with this problem?
1,I am hard of hearing but I can't hear from my sister speak her to me not listen not work ! I usually look video phone and text messenger from deaf they text their phones . Because ,It's emergency but how I call relay operator sign language on video TV to my video HDTV Sorenson from FCC Sorenson ! It's very important for me law . I'm Maria Lara ( Deaf Human )
0,Can we please get updates to improve stability and functionality. Videos stop and don't play correctly. Crashes a ton! Please help or I'll no longer be on the fore phone. I love it but the apps from Amazon blow.
1,Good tool. Jump around sometimes while message is being written.
1,I love this messenger. It's easy to install and use for everyone.
1,This actually works better for me then the resident Facebook one.
0,Too bloated, too intrusive, and ends up using up too much memory.
1,I have been using this app on my last Galaxy 3. It is a good app.
1,I have to use the mute notifications a lot because of group chats
0,But lags and notifies still even if I read the message elsewhere

0,I am really tired of Facebook invasion into our privacy..I am actively looking for another means of social medIA communication
0,The app works well, Facebook stinks. Make sure to turn off the location tracking on this app if you want any kind of privacy!!

1,I use this on my cell and now on my kindle6. I am not into FB like I use to be but it is just like texting. Good free program!
1,Whenever I get kicked from a group chat, then added back I still can't reply which results in me having to reinstall the app.
0,Too big of a pain. Not that knowledgeable about my new Smart Phone. would just as soon post messages the old way on facebook.
1,I have a Kindle Fire and this app works almost perfectly! It glitches sometimes, but that's because my Kindle is kind of old.

1,I love it. I have limited texting but with facebook messenger which was free is wonderful. it easy to use.
0,This app blows. It's some stupid internet thing that asks for your photo. Avoid it, it's probably the NSA.
1,Perfect sidekick to chat when you have Facebook . It separates your chat into its own app which is helpful
0,little circle with photo in it always appears on whatever page i am on. don't know how to make it go away.

0,Keeps.crashing,.freezing.and in need.of download please update !! Not thrilled!
1,Video calls are pretty decent quality just wish it'd let me do speech to text.
0,Keeps crashing. When it didn't do this it worked fine, now it won't even open.
1,App works as expected. Easy to use. My only dislike is the notification sound.
1,I see complaints about it not working with their kindle hdx. Mine works great
1,I downloaded this on my daughter's tablet. She has found use for this. Thanks.
1,I love this I don"t know what I would do with out it. I use this everyday.
0,The fire 7 slows down after installing the app Accelerated battery drain.
0,Would be great if I actually got notifications without having to check it every 20 minutes. It logs me out. Kind of defeats the purpose of having it
0,this app is incomparable with kindle fire???? I saw earlier reviews and I thought they updated it since then! please try upgrading it facebook!!!!!
1,Great app. Whether it comes from the message line in the full Facebook or chat or from someone using messenger all of them can e seen from this app
0,I HATE IT. IT WON'T STAY OPEN I CAN OPEN IT FOR TEN SECONDS THE IT WILL CLOSE OUT OF IT AUTOMATICALLY. I WOULD GIVE IT NEGATIVE 30 STARS OF I COULD
0,It would have been nice to have operating instructions for this app. It seems to work somewhat. Is there somewhere to get operating instructions?
1,The only complaint I have us that there aren't any of those fun things down with the stickers. Otherwise, can't really complain!!!,????????
0,I downloaded this and the Facebook app for my Kindle Fire and both were blocked because they contained the same Trojan, according to my Kindle. ???
1,It's fun to chat on messenger. You have lots of options , little icons, pictures, even video chat, if you want. I use it every day!! ???
0,Its ah good app but kindle is just stupid for not being totally comparable to it. Just fix it stupid people so it can work better. Thanks
1,This is a Great App. It works well with just a little time delay, so don't chatter on when using it or both persons will be talking over the other.
1,Great for private messaging between fellow Facebookers who don't want the whole bloody World in on there personal life's. I don't think it works on the F.B.I. (LOL)
1,It work exactly the way I needed it too,also with the feature that let's you see who is active on FB keeps you in touch and informed of you're friends availability .
0,I think when I downloaded this app my kindle started doing some weird things. No problems before this app, could be user error but...I ended up just uninstalling it.
0,Whatever you say it will not work on my kindle fire. It always says that it is corrupted. Facebook, you will get better reviews if you make it work on kindle fires.
1,Useful app for my Kindle Fire. I always like to check my facebook and my phone isn't set up for it. This app made it easier to get to my messages on my kindle fire.
1,This is to everyone who's reviews say that this app is incompatable with your device... it is compatable because when I opened the app it took me to a log in screen
1,Oh my, didn't know that I could have something like this on my phone. Works great and I'm able to upload my pictures on my Sale page. Has been working just great.
1,This app makes texting on Facebook a hell of a lot easier I love it I'm a Facebook addict lol make more apps for Facebook like we're u can video Chat wit ur friends
1,It is very helpful and keeps things easier its cool to talk to yo friends on the messenger because it makes shore that u get the message right away when it comes in
1,I just downloaded it and going hot. I put it on a HD 7 in and a HDX 8.9. Going hot...looks ok. Ok gotta bore you some. It still is working Wish me good luck.
1,Seems to work great for me.
0,It takes up too much memory

1,Just as useful as Facebook messaging on the Facebook website.
1,Excellent for communicating with multiple folks and fast too.
0,If it has less than one star than I would choose that rating.
1,Very convenient to use, the screen alerts are good reminders.
1,Those that say it doesnt work, it does. Learn how to use s***
0,It always says that it's trying to get a network connection.

1,Works well
1,Works well
1,My successfully downloaded this app and it works just fine for my Kindle Fire HD. People are saying it's not compatible with the device but it must be Amazon not Facebook because mine works.
0,I WAS FINE ON FB RECORDING VOICE MESSAGES UNTIL I UPGRADED, NOW BACK TO TEXTING.PLEASE FIX FOR KINDLE FIRE. So if anyone else likes to leave voice instead of text well find something else.
1,It does work on Kindle Fires but you have to get certain headphones. You have to get the ones that have a thing to speak into like the ones for phones those actually work with messenger.
1,I think it's a great app! It works great on my Galaxy S3 and it makes chatting with your facebook friends much easier since you don't have to launch facebook just to check your messages.
1,The app has problems with the main facebook app, ima asumming cuase it competties with Facebook instant messaging, if you use another facebook app with limited instant messager abilty it is the coolest widget to communicate with your facebook friends, i cant wait when it works with text messaging that are connected to imei number. It is really cool how it connect people
0,Really??? WHY? Amazon Fire users NEED this app. Very sad
1,Not sure why all I see is, &#34;not compatible with Kindle Fire.&#34;? I have a Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; and this app works as exspected. Not sure why some users have had less than optimal experinces.
0,Wish I didn't have to use it, since it's another app I have to have and keep on my all ready cluttered phone. But I haven't had any problems getting messages or responding to messages.
0,i'm so glad messenger is compatible with kindle now but i can't seem to send any attachments like emojis, voice recordings, or pictures neither through the messenger or facebook app?
0,Decent messenger service but as it has been for quite a long time needs improvement. Can end up taking allot of on board memory if you have a smaller device. Threads often disappear
1,I use it on my kindle fire and my Lenovo tablet and it works great for both
0,Really convenient via its integration with my Fire. I was slow in trying.
0,I went off Facebook please make sure I'm taken off . Seem to hard to use .
1,I love knowing when someone is trying to reach me. With out opening a link
0,Worked for like 6 hours an now it jus constantly crashes.. Thx WhackBook!!
1,It works as expected. I down loaded it because Facebook left me no choice.
1,Works as expected. Occasionally will close but does on other platforms too
0,I don't even know what to do with it. I have not used it, that I know of.
1,Good to be on if you like all the hype going on outside your world at home

1,Woooooow
1,Downloaded this the other day for my Kindle Fire. I have been using it for a week and thus far have experienced nothing negative to say about it. It integrates perfectly with the Facebook App I am using, and allows me to message my friends with ease from my Kindle Fire.
1,I got a kindle for a while ago and have been waiting for this app to come out! The only thing wing of that I can't send picture's or stickers I have an HD so I shouldn't be having this problem! Shouldn't be hard to fix though
0,don't like the fact that it seems I can't keep using my droid messenger app without upgrading to the new Messenger app that seems much more intrusive. I have not installed it yet on my phone because of the long list of permissions and changes required.
0,I have problems with this app. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD. When I have Facebook open and I receive a message from the Messenger, if I answer it, Facebook freezes up. The only way I can get it to work properly, is to log out of Facebook. Then, I open the Messenger app. That's the only way I can get it to work!!!!!!
0,Once I figured out how to mute my notifications, I was happier. It was very intrusive, as I'm not on FB all the time. When I'm not on it, I don't want to know people are sending me messages. I don't need to know every second what's going on there. I prefer texting or emailing my friends or will chat within the FB program when I'm on it.
0,For the first couple weeks I've had my Fire the messenger app worked decently... A little slow but OK. But then I got a notification that I needed to update the app however, and since the &#34;update&#34; it will not work at all. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it just won't work anymore.
1,People have been saying "Not working for kindle fire?" It works perfectly fine for my fire.No problems with it yet. Wonderful, exactly how it is on other devices. Props to Facebook/Amazon for making a good app!
0,I'm not kidding they look through your photos, they can see your videos they can see you through your camera, they check everything you do they no your password they know everything, I'm not kidding Facebook is stalking on this app. Facebook.com is safe!
1,It allows you to send a text message over a wifi to FB and is wonderful when you do not have a Cell signal to send to their text. It is for your FB friends only, but that is the majority of your friends.
1,Good for when you wanna chat but not deal with all the other drama and blabber of FB. Enjoy the Emoji..could use more single words or phrases that aren't holiday related... add that and I give it a 5 star
1,love it

1,OMG it works so well, and now it works on kindle fire even the 2012 one so stop complaining
1,It's handy for a quick comment and when you can't turn up another method for quick contact.
1,I thought that is wasn't going to work, but once I started to really use it it was amazing.
0,pops up constantly, msg or not, stick with standard facebook msging. removed within 15 mins
1,I find it quick and easy. There is some concern about some of the permissions they require.
1,I love this. I almost never remember to log into facebook now that I can just use this app.
1,I am fairly new to Facebook but so far I like this Messanger part of it, it is super quick!
1,Love the new features of messenger! Downloaded this on my new kindle Fire 6. Works great!
0,Pop up faces constantly on screen. If multi users on computer.. other users see popups as they type and can read messages as messages are always open. Not good
0,Can't get messenger to stay on my new device!! I had it once and know it's gone! Keep trying to get it back and it won't stay for some reason! Very annoying!

1,I like the way it works . I like the way it works. I like the way it works. I like the way it works
1,It is a great way of communicating with others.It is fast and reliable.I highly recommend using it!!
0,I used my messenger 24/7 and you guess had to make it not work for the kindle fire!? GREAT JOB GUYS.
1,This app was finally added to Amazon! What do you know! I would give this 5 but it kills my battery.
1,I love this app cos makes me smile when opens..all my trends n new ones views n studies avails here
0,I just don't like messenger, I wish I could get the messages on FB, it takes a few seconds to load.
1,I honestly don't know why I am writing a review about a app on Amazon that is on Android and Apple.
0,Disappointing ....very slow.. Ads pop up interrupting tasks.
0,Doesn't allow you to erase messages after you read and answer
1,Closes circle tabs out once in awhile, but overall great app.
1,Can communicate without logging on to Facebook. Very helpful.
1,It is user friendly. My first experience was fun and awesome.
1,Glad to be able to have this on my kindle. Great addition...
1,This app is great but have problems with Amazon Fire Phone :|

0,Do not like this app. Prefer all my messaging ...and postings in one area...have to exit Facebook to use...only able to communicate with messenger people....not Facebook....both have to be messenger...seriously thinking of removing
0,Would be nice if the messenger on FB itself worked. Don't like that you have to have a separate one for android. However, my daughter likes the separate one so I gave it 3 stars. I don't like it because we don't like to download extra things that we don't or shouldn't really need to. FB needs to stop adding things that customers don't really need or want.
0,I love using Facebook Messenger chat & free world wide cell phone service. Messenger has many problems. Will not stay connected, you will write a few sentences and Facebook just goes out of the Messenger!! You loose what you wrote. Very annoying. Sometimes , I have to keep writing short messagers and send them. Then continued doing that until I am finnished !!
0,I did not like this because the faces of the recipients of my messages stayed on my screen. I could not figure a way to remove the faces from my screen. I feel as if I didn't have any privacy. I deleted the app.
0,Too much security risk with this app. I ONLY have it because I'm FORCED to by Facebook in order to receive PRIVATE messages from my friend's across the country!! I think Facebook should leave well enough alone & stop trying to make improvements that are just pushing people to look at other means of online communication OTHER THAN FACEBOOK!!!!!
1,In case you just want a certain to know something..you can get right to them without anyone else knowing...it's like texting..but I think quicker, plus you have more people to contact because most people now have I phones or androids..easy! Love it!
1,Such a fun, easy to use Facebook Messenger App for the Cell phone. I also like the you can do Video chat, and other cell phone videos *While using Facebook Friends* I personally believe it's faster, and easier to use for Video Chatting.
1,After reading all the negative comments that are all over a year or two old, I thought I'd try it. Worst scenario, I would uninstall it. I have absolutely no problems with it and it is sure better than having to go to type in the desktop mode because the Facebook mobile app doesn't allow me to see or answer messages.
0,It's bloated junk software that serves the same purpose as the full service app of its namesake. The only feature that makes it understandable to justify having the messenger app along with the original, on a smart phone, is that the notifications are more noticeable than the regular fb ones. All the other features and flashiness is redundant on a smartphone with a fb client already installed. No hate, but it's fb, so it's probably invading your privacy somehow at the trade-off for convenience and congruence. Because people are essentially lazy when they can get away with it.
0,Facebook Messenger is not for me! I'm not 'tied' to my phone. I did not like being reminded frequently that someone responded on Facebook. If you are a Facebook person then Messenger is for you. But it was definitely not for me
1,Awesome app!!

1,It works so great!! The only problem is that I don't know how to update the app.
1,Usually works without problems. Occasional delays but no more than 2-3 minutes.
0,Facebook messenger downloaded it ,but it will not open .What a waste of time.
1,I love this game very addicting. I get to playing it and don't want to stop.
0,Is not very compatible with fire phone. You people should really fix this.
0,There is an update available and not able to download for the kindle.
1,You can keep in touch without leaving the phone to text via contacts.
1,the only way to communicate for extended periods out of the country
0,There's already a personal message area in FB, but for some reason, if I'm on my Kindle or cell, I can't get those messages unless I use FB Messenger. Half the time I don't know I have messages on Messenger. FB Messenger is kind of irritating too because I don't use voice chat and people try to message me that way. Their faces appear in little circles on the screen of my Kindle and it's hard to get rid of them. Sometimes I experience freezing on my Kindle when I'm doing something and FB Messenger interrupts.
1,It does work on Kendal fire
1,Have not heard from anyone!

1,Very useful
1,Good for IM
1,Guys so I keep seeing reviews that day this doesn't work well it does work now so don't look at the old reviews there from months ago
1,I like the ability to make "calls" to other FBM users and carry on a voice conversation with people even out of the country.
0,Hard to get others on. Have trouble knowing if I can talk to friends or just have to text. Confusing to me. I'm new to all this .
1,Gives you access to messages quickly and conveniently without getting sucked into scrolling through your FB newsfeed for 20 minutes.
1,I preferred it the other way!!! I think this app is unnecessary I hate that it's on all the time eating up my battery and data.
0,This app is ok but... I don't have the time to wait and keep on putting in emails and stuff. I highly recemend not getting this app.
1,A great way to chat with friends and family and the face to face works well even when your out of the country it keeps you in touch.
1,This is how I talk to my boyfriend and it works well on any phone,tablet,or even a kindle. It just doesn't let you call on a kindle.
1,Very satisfied with the products we've purchased through Amazon. Prime membership saves us shipping cost on most items we purchase.
0,This app doesn't work on kindle fire nor does it work with the Facebook app. It also will not update on kindle fire. Please fix it!!
0,I've downloaded and deleted this app multiple times this week from my Amazon fire phone and it still doesn't not work properly! It keeps crashing and after a period of inactivity I can't even pull the app up. I just get a blank screen.. I then delete the app and reinstalled it but no matter what it crashes on me throughout the day. Super frustrating! Please fix asap!
1,Not sure why I needed this app when I have FB, it shows up in message icon there too but I do find it annoying popping up when I'm browsing & it gets in the way causing me to open it & almost losing what I'm doing
0,This app works only partially on my Kindle Fire HD. It does enable me to handle messages on Facebook. And it does permit me to go directly to Messenger from my desktop screen. However, when a new notification pops up telling me to click on it to read the message, the link doesn't work. I tap the pop up but don't see the message. After that, my kindle freezes up and I often need to shut down and restart.
0,Ehh not like the original android app . You don't get the active chat head on your screen like the original android app. You have to actually open the app. If you fixed this it would be given a 5 star rating
0,I thought something was wrong. Same post kept showing up first for days. Don't have time to scroll through to find new posts. They are all mixed up! Please fix this so the latest posts show first. Very disappointed.
1,I really like messenger and use it regularly including the emoticons. It does seem to use up a lot of data on my phone when I do use it. I like the video, face to face option. My friend and I talk regularly through this function.
1,I just installed this and so far so good! I like that on the tablet the text is much more readable. I'll have to update this review after having it awhile and let you know if it has any problems. This is a nice App to stay in touch with facebook friends & you don't have to have facebook installed on your tablet either!
1,I like chatting with this app, the chat heads on the Android homescreen is awesome, however, I do have some privacy concerns while using it. But I guess it's something to expect while using Facebook.
0,I have used the app on a smartphone and switched to my Kindle. I can't use some of the same features and stickers and I keep getting a notice to update the app, but there is no update available in the app store.
0,To reviewer saying everyone just complainers, well guess what You R Wrong- go ahead type Facebook in the kindle app store, and guess what pops up? Go ahead check it out, that is what I downloaded, because I thought maybe Facebook app is what I should get, I saw Facebook Messenger and picked that to stay in contact. Oh well
1,Best way to communicate with my family and friends who are spread all over the country and beyond! Fast, Easy and private!
1,Love that I can keep in touch with my friends. There are some minor glitches but not enough to keep me from using it!
0,its soooooooooo dumb because it wont load on kindle fire! I would not get this app it sucks. try a text now or texting app
0,It's messenger, really.... umm yeah! whatever? Yet another Facebook idea...Umm yeah, right, right, o.k. were done here...
0,Doesn't work for the Kindle Fire HD. Sure it will load and open. Just try to send or read a message, locks up every time.
1,So i use this alot on my kindle since i never have my phone on me this is a great way for people to get in touch with me.
1,Don't worry I am pretty sure it works fine on the FIRE because I have it and it work perfectly. I highly recommend it! ?
0,Not all messages came over as conversation heads. What's the point if I still have to get into Facebook to get messages?
1,This product works. It takes a goodly amount of space on my phone, but to communicate on FB, it is absolutely essential.

0,It is capable with the kindle fire but it is really slow and glitchy
0,Do not like. The old one was better. It wants access to your info.
0,I have not had it long . I like it so far and hope to use it a lot.
0,In theory a good way to keep up on Facebook. once I figured out how to stop getting people's heads on my tablet I liked it better. Almost deleted messenger over that.
0,Messenger and Facebook apps ARE crap, and always WILL be crap. I use Facebook in a browser if i need to. Save your battery life and save your headache, use a Browser.
1,This is a great way to chat with your Facebook friends via text through your internet device of your choice and can even call through Facebook. I love this messenger!
1,If I am waiting for a response from someone this app is perfect. You don't have to keep going on to check. The person's picture will just pop up like a little bubble.
0,Even though the app works for Kindle Fire, it still sucks. I tried and tried to call with it, and it just resests back to the regular page. Same with answering calls.
1,Best app ever ot is free + it will show up on your phone kindle tablet whatever you got it works the best app Pleease get but you have to have a Facebook account ??
0,I was allowed to download it, but when I open it, the screen goes black and the app stops responding. make it compatible with Kindle Fire. this is pathetic, Facebook.
0,serious security issues. It's a good app, convenient, but it asks for power to do almost everything, for example, to initiate a phone call without you asking it to...
1,I use this apt a lot.
0,There are so many buggy things going on with this on my Kindle Fire. I tried to delete it, but then I'd have no messenger at all. Please fix this as soon as you can.

1,I have only used messenger one time, but it worked fine.
1,I can use my Fire Tablet to view and answer FB messages.
0,A lot of chasing that "bubble" to get a message!
1,It,s great, but would be better if I knew how to use it.
0,Very glitchy. Closes at random. Needs a fix desperately.
0,Could not get on and keep getting knock off of Facebook?
0,this messenger maybe for some people but I don`t use it.
1,Is a great way of communicating with friends and family.
0,It's very convenient, easy to use, but my concern is only how private is it with hackers in the world. Not that I have anything to hide, but it creeps me out that despicable people need to pry into others lives. Maybe even have a capability to use your messenger to send false messages using your account.
1,I really like how you can see people that are awesome people are at because people that are you could talk to people that are at maybe don't like to talk to you when they're not on and sometimes I get mad but thank you for having me do this I really like this.
0,I hate this app with a passion. Not only is it crazy that I can't read my emails on Facebook but I have to download another app just to read and respond to them but it's crazy that when someone is emailing you their face pops up and doesn't go away after reading and even replying. It's crazy. I spent way too long on my vacation trying to download an app in the middle of the ocean and then trying to figure out how to get rid of my mother-in-laws face from the middle of my phone. I couldn't wait to delete this app.
1,My wife has been using this for some time and got me to download it for my Kindle. I am not very pro-Facebook, but this seems to work well. What can I say, Facebook isn't all bad. Hey Zuckerberg, keep up the good work.
1,Seems to be a delay in the notifications sometimes so I don't know that I've gotten a message while I'm on my Kindle unless I happen to see it on my phone. Works well other than that though and does what is designed for, although why Facebook decided to split their messenger off into a separate app is beyond me.
0,IT DOES WORK PRETTIFIED, IT SAYS INCREASED BY 23%, I KIND OF DOUBT THAT BUT IT DOES INCREASE BASE SOUND AND NOT JUST THE VOLUME EITHER. KINDLE FIRE 2015 MODEL SUCKS I THINK AND THE SOUND IS HORRIBLE, THE TONES THAT COME WITH THIS ARE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR IF NEAR BASIC TRAFFIC. I would give more *'s but I hate when an ALP gives you a % that never changes, like the 23% it just says that just to make one feel better by giving a number
1,Works great, not full of adds. My facebook friends can reach me like a text message. I also use this to communicate with selling things through facebook. Your able to respond in a timely manner without having the use the facebook app.
1,I don't know why this has any low ratings -- it works just fine. The design is easy to read and looks nice, and it connects seamlessly. No complaints from me! (I have a Fire Phone. I can't speak to how well it does or doesn't work with other devices.)
1,It works and keeps my messages separate from group messages. However I wish the ones that went to my other inbox would have a place on here too. I do like that you can voice message and call people from the app. However I don't always like random calls from people that I hardly know. It also freezes up sometimes but I've learned to just deal with it.
1,I think this is a great app and it makes messaging on Facebook so much easier. Idk why people are saying it's not compatible with kindle fire. It works on mine just fine. The only thing is I'm having a little trouble finding the gifs but really other than that it's great.
1,Easy and great. Love it.
1,Works GREAT! I love it!
1,I like it. Works great.
1,Makes messaging so easy.
1,Its ok, needs to improve
1,Works great on my phone!
1,I know this will help me
1,love facebook messenger
0,Kept freezing the screen
0,The fire phone ITS s....
1,Awesome! I'm so glad they made it available for the kindle fire. The regular Facebook app doesn't work for me, and this app makes it easy to chat.
0,Needless piece of nonsense. Chat in the FB app worked just fine. I HATE having to have this intrusive, extraneous software for such a basic task.
0,Doesn't work for amazon fire..... But why tho. Was for a very short time, maybe not even 24 hours after installing then it just keeps crashing..
0,How many years do FB/Kindle programmers need to make this simple messenger compatible with Kindle Fire? C'mon folks, you can do better than this.
1,No complaints, it works fine on my kindle hd, other reviews had said it didn't, but I use the instant messaging and video chat without a problem.
1,It's nice to have a place for private conversations not readily available to prying eyes of those you don't want viewing what is being discussed.
1,My phone just broke, so right now it's helping a lot. Other than that I never use it. 4 stars for helping me get through the death of my phone!!!
1,Had a glitch at first but it seamed to clear up. But a good app. I dont have to always use my phone because I get alerts on my kindle. Very nice.
1,All the controversy about privacy aside, having a stand along messenger app is a great addition if you use Facebook to organize community events.
1,I started using this just yesterday it's really great I still need to figure out a sound that I can detect when incoming data is being sent to me
1,An easy way to contact friends and family. Great app.
1,I have no problems with Facebook messenger . Love it.
1,nice to be able to "text" my facebook friends
1,FAST and easy to communicate with friends and family.
1,great way to stay in contact with friends and family.
0,I think it's great every one should try it even once.
1,I really like it. Just wish you could PHOTO the page.
0,I dont like that its seperate from the other web page
0,Works pretty good. I prefer the old interface though.
0,This doesn't have a recorder on it for kindle fire hd
1,Love it private and fast
1,Private messages perfect
1,Love the video chat.....
1,Love it very easy to use
1,Love it! So easy to use!
1,On my Amazon kindle fire
1,Works on fire hd 6
1,Couldn't live without it
1,So easy to use and fast.
1,Love it really great app
0,I have uninstalled/installed it 5 times this month due to repeatedly getting "quit working" messages. Hope that gets fixed soon.
1,New to me so just learn, like the instant messaging. Don't have to click several other places to finally get to correspond with someone.
0,Interfered with my system. Seemed jumbled and hard to distiguish between other messages. I uninstalled shortly after trying to use it.
1,I like messenger and the fact I can erase complete conversations. It tends to be private and as long as it stays that way I will use it!
0,Facebook, is this really necessary? If I want to contact someone instantly I will text them. Do messages really require their own app?
1,I'm gonna use it....think it will be good...if u wanna get this app go to settings? device?`allow installation of app.....
1,Works fine on the Fire Phone! Go into settings to turn off Chat Heads if you don't want those annoying circles around everything you do.
0,Got it only because people I know use it and want to contact me with it. Works OK, I always seem to have a problem 'ending' the message.
1,I just downloaded the app yesterday and it works just fine on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;! I can't stop using it, it's so entertaining.
1,love love love it
1,So far the messages that I've received were very easy to retrieve. A very good app.
0,Will not take my facebook password, and yes, i am putting the correct one 25 times.
0,I am not able to use it as I dont have a smart phone. It is only on my Kindle Fire.
1,i have been with f.b. for a very long time. i havelots of friends there and family.
1,Having difficulty sending posted video from my time line to a friend's message box.
1,Amazing allows multitasking. Able to be on Facebook and game or work from my kindle
1,Works great...thank you Amazon customer service for the advice on using this app...
0,Do not use this app, kept popping up on my Kindle coukd not erace from the screen.
1,So far okay.....I was really hesitant in installing this on my phone but I'm glad.
1,I enjoy using messenger. Works great when I chat with friends out of country!
1,Well... Fast and easy to use... Manages all the chats without the need of passing through facebook itself
1,I like Messenger, although I did read some reviews that caused me to disconnect from it a couple of times Privacy and hacking issues....however after doing some research I found it to be ok so connected again when and if I am on FB
1,I have a kindle fire hd it works perfectly
1,I avoided this app for a long time, hearing alarming reports about it in the media. But further research seemed to indicate it was really OK, and now that I have it, I love it. My phone makes a tiny Zing-ring noise when a message comes through, easy to check. Only irritation was the first time the Chat Head appeared and I couldn't figure out how to get rid of it. Finally, a text box came up that explained the solution: press the chat-head and an X appears at the bottom of the screen, then drag the head to the X and "Poof" it's gone. Note: I'm not a power-user of Facebook, still text way more than chat.
1,There are times when I rather just have Facebook messenger running instead of having the Facebook app going. I actually find that having the messenger app on my kindle fire works much better than the app on my phone. Since I take my kindle everywhere this allows me to keep in contact with those who I talk to regularly and also not cut into my data limits on my phone. Overall it works better than the other one that I have and I like it better.
1,So yea, there's a lot of negative reviews , but I guess they fixed it. I'm writing this on November 22-2014, and this app works wonderfully well. It gives you the feature to have chat heads, so you can send messages while running something else on the device, at the same time, anyways it works great.
1,Works fine with both my Kindle Fire 7 & the family Fire 8.9 that my son uses most. Tested it out for my friend who has the 4 G version, and it looks and reacts like the PC version, as ours are tethered to wi-fi and are not as portable for social media. I mention my son as if you do not set controls on them via Kindle Freetime or the sync'd parental controls, they can use it on accident or purpose. He'd rather not have everything open for use, so it is a nice way to test it for my friends with kids who want to have everything open.
0,For an app I'm forced to have if I want to communicate privately on Facebook, it's not horrible. I wish it were a little more user friendly. I don't like how sometimes it kicks me out after I've typed a bunch. Or I have difficulty getting the keyboard to keep working. Sometimes I can see that someone messaged me, but I can't open it. works fine most of the time. when it gives me trouble I re-install it. When in doubt, reinstall.
1,I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those "filler" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar "guide" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have "those other 100 channels I really don't watch", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost
0,Whoever thought having an annoying chat bubble invading their screen is clearly some unsavory individual who likes to work up a sweat then walk into a swarm of mosquitoes. The same person must keep a pet fly that they trained to buzz in their ear as soon as they fall asleep. The same person who pays someone to drag their finger nails across a chalk board. The same person who styles Donald Trumps hair. The same person who designed the sound of a fax machine. The same person who let's their dog poo in your yard. The same person who enjoys snow in April. The same person who enjoys infomercials. The same person who loudly plays ghetto rap in their 1993 pickup truck with low tires and, $800.00 rims, and blown speakers. Yes, that is the same person who made the decision that those chat bubbles were a good idea. They must have sat and thought, "we can't make this thing too good, so we probably should ad a feature so annoying that a person would rather get a case of pinworm while both hands are broken then have to deal with this feature" Yes those chat heads did the trick.

1,I don't know about the others bad reviews,but its working on my kindle fire 5th generation
0,Since the last updates, the app bogs down and NO videos will load... ever.
0,Every time I open this app it just goes white than dumps me out.
0,This is a very hand app if you are social on fb, but it's constantly crashing on my Kindle Fire. Looks like its an uncommon thing compared to other people experience with it, but for me, it's keeping me from really enjoying the app. I find myself having to uninstall it, then reinstall it weekly, and it's annoying. Hopefully there's an update to help me in the near future.
0,I downloaded this on my android and on my kindle. Every time I turn my kindle on, it "catches up" with every single message I did on my phone, instead of continuing where it should have left off, regardless of device I typed it on. It is very irritating. And it kills my battery then waiting for them to all come through and quit flashing.
0,Didn't work for me on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus with Android 4.0. Would cause the tablet to freeze. I had to get another app that works perfectly, Go!Chat. Sorry Facebook, but you didn't DO IT this time.
0,Can someone find me the fb app for fire phone?
0,My calls are being drop wish I could say better
0,Read the permissions first before you download
0,You don't put Android on the tablet and force us to use your o/s which by the way is inferior, greatly to Google Android; and the app does nothing but FORCECLOSE, to those who aren't techies it's junk, unusable on Fire O/S (what Kindle tablets run on) - why leave it available? Furthermore, the Facebook app doesn't notify you whenever a new FB message comes in. This is pathetic and someone who knows some code could get with FB and your developers and fix the problem. Users, until you see people posting positive remarks don't download...usr a pc, Mac, or Android phone or tablet. This is silly Amazon.
1,You will want this if you message friends

0,This is not compatible to kindle fires really Can't even make a call from messenger n actually hear what the person is saying This needs to be corrected like for real It needs to be able to work with any device including kindle fires Because just everybody else we want to be able to make free messenger calls for our kindles as well
0,The app kicks me out every time I try and open messenger to talk. I am using it on a kindle fire, but this just started happening recently. It was working fine at first. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times with no luck of the problem resolving itself. It is absolutely frustrating!
0,Read the privacy statement. Woah! Facebook is getting out of control with their anti-privacy practices. Completely unnecessary-absolutely unnecessary. Facebook: Hey, do you want to chat with your friends? Me: Yeah who wouldn't? Facebook: After you download this app, I will store extra data on your device silently and will make silent calls through your phone and WTH why not, I will also mine your data Me: UHH, I didn't ask for this. But I can chat with my friends right? Facebook: OH yeah yeah yeah, sure...of course you can. I just need to silently inject extra data onto your device
1,I saw a whole bunch of reviews about how it wasn't compatible for Kindle Fire and got scared that I'd accidentally downloaded something faulty. But it works pretty well. I guess they updated it? Wither way try re-downloading it again if your first experience with the app didn't go so well.
1,Those who say it is not compatible with kindle fire are wrong just downloaded it on my kindle fire worked fine the only thing was no video chat because kindle fire doesn't have a camera has no lag our glitch on kindle fire that it doesn't on a phone
1,i love it alot it is good for my dell tablet
0,This is a good app and all but on my kindle fire I don't get my messages on my home screen at all I got to go in the app to get my messages I won't know that I have a message until I open the app please fix this thank you
0,This app crashes every day on my Fire phone. Have to uninstall and reinstall. Facebook needs to fix the bugs in this app so it works properly. It even crashed several times a week on my other Android phones.
1,Using messenger has been very beneficial to help me discuss topical like Psoriasis. Many sufferers are looking for support. I'm available most any day to help. My FB Group name is Overcoming Psoriasis. Hope to see you there.
0,Updated this and now it wontevwn open. Crashes as soon as you click it. Not cool!!
1,Very good app.. works much like the phone app.. much more responsive than before..
1,Love the little ' ding' I get with each message to let me know someone has written
1,Even if this does not work with a kindle fire it works perfect in any other device
1,I enjoy using fb messenger, I can get a hold of anyone that is on my friends list.
1,I really like the new FB Messenger. It allows the conversation to seem SO private.
0,Does not work too well on my kindle fire. The conversations take too long to load.
0,I think it's stupid to have to go to another app on the mobile to chat while on fb
1,This is a good app for Messaging your friends while playing apps. And it is FREE!
1,OK this has worked great on my Kindle so far. Easy to stay in touch with everyone.

1,I love messenger cause I have no problem to talk to any one I want that is the best apps
1,As always. Better than texting. Most of my friends prefer this over texting. Great job.
1,I do not have a smart phone, so I cannot text. Messenger meets that need on my tablet.
0,Why did they make this junk a seperate app? I found no use for it at all. Data hog
1,Like the vidio calling but sometimes it is echoing or has problems streaming the calls.
1,Love messenger as it's easy to read! Do not like the new Facebook look that gets a zero

1,Great app
0,When I open the app, the screen is just white..
1,It's ok good game
0,Everyone's REVIEWS say It Looks Great, But It Really Don't. Y'all Foolin...Smh
1,Facebook Messenger allow you to have two party conversations while in your Facebook account. This is very helpful and allows you to say in Facebook and not have to go to another Messenger service.
1,It's always very quick and simple to access. Minimizes so you can use other apps, but opens back up with just a click on the chat head! Very data efficient and efficient processing/ram use as well.
0,Read previous reviews that said app didn't work, but those reviews were mostly over a year old. Unfortunately, I found them to be painfully accurate still. All I could get was a blank white screen.
1,Couldn't work better. Face it, Facebook is a dominant, in your face program. With all that we don't know about what they use our information for, as a social media platform there's nothing better.
0,Having to have a separate app to message people is so stupid and a waste of space. Can't believe someone would force you to have an additional app just to message people. Stupid stupid stupid!!!!!
0,Messenger has updated on my Galaxy S4 3 times. I have had to uninstall it 2 of the 3 times and then re-install. Problem with the S4 or messenger? I do not know but next it will not be re-installed
0,I am not too computer or tablet savvy, and I didn't see directions on how to use Messenger. If possible, could you help me learn to use messenger. Thank you, gparsons868@hotmail.com
1,its a good facebook messenger I liked thanks for application I comunition my family and more people my mom my dad my brother I liked application for this happy and mensage for my girl friend
0,well.. it works for my kindle fire but I don't get notifications.. and when I use it on my phone then go on my kindle fire to use it Ny messages don't atomtically pop up. I have ti make it pop up.
0,Please update dis app man
1,it was a little confusing at first. it was different than facebooks. it is working out well.
1,Great way to communicate, but wish there were a set of "how to use" rules attached.
0,Don't like the bubble picture always on my screen or people always knowing when I'm on line.
1,Super easy way to keep in contact with others. Does have some glitches,but over all good app
1,Works great on my Kindle. No freezing so far. Notifications are pretty fast and up to date.
1,It's alright. It will crash sometimes and I would like it to be faster with the upgrades -.-
0,You can't even use messenger and Facebook or musically without losing data easily this sucks
1,Love the fact that this is for my new kindle device. Now I am truly connect everywhere I go,
1,Enjoy getting the messages instantly from friends and family sooner. Nice feature to have.
0,I'm not understanding the "concept" of messenger.....but I guess I'll have to learn.
1,its easy, fast, and simple. get this app daawgg... 420 all day every day. smoke weed every day. get stoneed.
0,I won't even give it one star. I only gave it one because I had to.This app sucks and doesn't even load.
1,I feel it is very personnel and out right wonderful. Feels like your right there with your loved ones.
0,Only shows a blank screen than a message saying it's not responding. Please fix. Thank you.
0,The app asks for way too many permissions. Use my camera without my knowledge, nope don't think so. Deleted the app. Now I can't message with facebook anymore on my phone. If I could give zero stars I would!
0,So I tried to download it but I waited 15 minutes and as soon as it got done it would make me do it over I honestly think that this app should be compatible with any device I mean why would they would this in the app store if kindle fire users couldn't use it
1,Best way to text your friends and family. Feelings lonely? Text your friends with messenger!!
0,Needs updates we are not able do do as much as a android user can Updates please.

1,Love it!! I can keep in touch with friends and family immediately for free!!!
1,Very clean, easy to follow, and updates fast. I use it as my main way of contacting people and it helps me so much.
1,I am not really interested in facebook messenger. I just don't have the time. I am sure it is a nice program.
1,FB Messenger works seamlessly and an easy way to communicate with your closest friends.I highly recommend this app.
1,This app is good but why can't you have access to the android store! We need an instagram ASAP, AND I MEAN NOW!??
1,Um the stickers don't work why this stupid but everything is okay just wished the stickers worked it pisses me off
1,This app is amazing!! Im so glad i downloaded it. It helps me see my messages faster. Thanks for who ever made it
0,Works good not thrilled "HAD" to DL it because the FB app no longer does the messages, silly to have 2 apps
0,when i put the volume down the notification ringtone still comes on and it's so loud is there a way it can be fixed
0,App itself works fine. Just unsure about how I feel about the invasive app "permissions" that are required.
1,Love it. Great product, very helpful to know when people have had a chance to review the messages. No complaints!
0,Didn't care for it and wouldn't use it again. Within 30 minutes of signing up for this my account Facebook account was hacked into and after changing the password was hacked again in just a few minutes. Not saying that Messenger was responsible but was odd that it happened twice so soon after.
0,(Kindle Fire HDX)This app downloaded perfectly fine, I can use the chat head, it's not slow, BUT the stickers don't work! I downloaded tons of stickers on a phone I had, but now I can't use any of them. It needs to be fixed soon!
0,This app is slow and crashes randomly while I am texting people. A new update has been out for a while where users can play basketball and Amazon still hasn't given us the update. Come on Amazon give me the updates on time and this will be a 5 star review.
1,I love messenger. The video calls have less interference and better quality than FaceTime. I also enjoy sharing pictures and videos with my family with the simple touch of a button.
0,Get the update already, it's been forever. This is getting absolutely ridiculous. I constantly have a reminder on the app itself telling me to update.
0,every time there is an upgrade it does not open, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. Can you help me solve the problem I am having.
1,It's a great title, it has the occasional glitch, but you can fix it by just turning the system all the way off.
0,Good job Facebook. Just had to delete the Facebook app and messenger because of lack of phone memory. There is no reason to have to open an entire separate app just to check messages in the original app other than to be dominant in phone memory. So goodbye Facebook. Hello freedom from distraction.
0,videos not working
0,Ok, it works, then it auto updates, then it quits working. Is there no support for the fire phone at all?

0,Seeing reviews from 2014 about compatibility with Kindle Fire.....and there's STILL a problem with this?
1,Compatible with fire. All emojis except the the thumb don't expand when the emoji button is held down ?
1,Quickly decide whether or not to respond to messages, messages that I sometimes don't want to deal with.
0,I can do almost everything but make and receive calls. It never connects whenever someone tries to call.
1,I have an original kindle fire. It works great. I appreciate getting notification s when I get messages.
0,I did not care for it personally. I tried it for two days and then I got rid of it. Just not my thing.

1,I like it cause it's way better than texting in facebook and because I can put way more different stickers in messanger
1,Some friends prefer this to texting and this app works just fine for that--cool if people don't have your phone number.
0,its stupid that were have to have this to message people.. it's so annoying!=/ it messes up all the time and is so slow

1,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE OTHER PEOPLES DEAL IS. THIS IS A GOOD WORKING APP. TRUST ME
1,It's good, I have no problem using Facebook messenger. It gets the job done for me.
0,Wish I could give less isn't working at all for my fire or phone. Please fix.!!!!!!
1,Works great but its not the fastest but is much more easier then going on Facebook.
0,I took it off because the blue message bar would not go away after viewing message.
1,It is a great app. Communication with my friends on Facebook is a whole lot easier.
1,Besides commercials love that I can watch all the Whose Line shows, every season...
1,I love Facebook Messenger. The only thing I don't like about it, is that when I'm typing a response to somebody that has sent me a message, the textbox clicks out an I have to reclick into the textbox.
0,No way does FB need all those invasive permissions just to message. Why separate it from the original FB anyway? Only to spy. No way will I download this to my phone! Only ones who do just didn't read the permissions, or don't know how dangerous invasion of privacy is.
1,I am not going to add my Verizon phone and text to my Amazon Fire - have to pay for it as an extra device each month, with a large hook up fee up front. However, Faceboo Messenger is just as good, if not better!
1,Facebook Messenger is really cool because it shows all of my previous messages from Facebook and it also lets me text all of my friends on Facebook, even my friends without a Facebook Messenger Badge can still reach me. Facebook Messenger is awesome, and very compatible with the Kindle Fire HD. I agree that Face book Messenger should be kept in any app store, and deserves a five star rating because it's just like Facebook, except smarter, and better. Sincerely, Satisfied Facebook Messenger User
0,Facebook hit a new low with this app. It?s a pointless waste of space and the time it took me to download it.. I was perfectly happy with the Facebook mobile app, all my FB needs were perfectly satisfied .What I did not need was FB making me DL a whole other app that literally does absolutely nothing the FB mobile app couldn?t do, It is constantly trying to get me to allow push notifications every time I try to use it, and ultimately just takes up more space on my kindle. It?s as though every part of the app was designed to be as obnoxious and unnecessary as possible.
0,Due to me being a massive net head, I like apps that allow me to talk to people on FB. This app works great as a stand alone all, but it has a tendency to crash whenever you do anything else. It's not right away, but it happens quite often. Other than that, it's a decent app.
1,I love it. I get chat and see me husband when I travel. My daughter lives 3 states away and we can keep up as well. And when I. Don't have good phone service messenger works well. You need not be a genius to figure this out
0,Make it compatible for us Kindle Fire users. This should be compatible with a tablet like Kindle Fire. You Facebook Guys making us buy the messenger app because you are getting rid of messages from the Facebook app. If you don't make this compatible by the end of the year, I'll make sure that you don't have me as a Facebook user anymore. Because this is outrageous. Either you make this compatible with my kindle fire, or you can say goodbye to me as a user of Facebook! Who's with me?!
0,I was excited to finally find this for my kindle, but lately the messenger And the Facebook app will not connect to the internet, keeps shutting down, will not even connect to my games. I used to love Facebook. What happened?
0,Most apps are outdated and so it is true that the real Facebook app is not avaipllable at Amazon App store coz I have not seen it for 2 months!
1,Like because I can do other things on my Kindle and know I will still get my messages in a timely manner.
1,Ive been using the app for years now with no issues. The addition of call and video calling has improved.
1,It worked really well. I actually loved it. Thank the Lord for this. And fan fictions. And one direction.
1,I spend a lot of time on Facebook a lot of my friends are on there. I've never had any problems with it..
0,I downloaded it onto my Kindle HDX, and immediately started having problems with the browser freezing up.
1,I like this app on my kindle. It works great but you can not use extras on it like giphy or voice record.
1,Really like it , but it has been freezing up my kindle to where I have a hard time closing out sometimes.
1,Don't know why people say it doesn't work on Kindle fire, that's what I'm using right now! Kindle fire HD
1,I put this on my kids Kindles so I could talk to them while I was out of the country. It worked perfect.
1,You guys who are complaining probably have old kindle models, mine works fine and it's really convenient.

1,New flash people it does work with the Kindle fire HD I couldn't believe it at first but it really works
0,You text any one on Facebook but can not call anyone on it so stupid but it's still cool 3 Starrs for it
1,Like the Facebook messenger it's easy to use and fast.. I would recommend it to all my Facebook family.
1,Love this as a fast and convenient way to get in touch with people all over the planet when you need to.
0,Not sure why it doesn't work with kindle since they share droid operating systems but very disappointed.
0,I hate it & hate that I was forced to download it just so I could send private messages or receive the.
1,Great for keeping in touch internationally without telephone charges! Fast, efficient and easy to use!

0,didnpot order this
1,Fun app! Love it!
1,it is a great tool
0,dont feel i needed
1,a nice app to have
0,just dont like it.
1,Hi
0,useless, can just use browser to go to facebook. Also, if you chat a bit on your computer, then later turn on your phone your phone goes crazy alerting you to pages of messages you have already read.
1,Good app and works as needed and they keep it up to date a lot. I probably use this more than text now a days. still dont know why texting does not have some features like this does. I like to see when people get a message and see it.
1,I totally enjoy using messenger! I prefer using this over the phone. Im always in contact with all my devices, and I like the fact I can see who is actually available, at anytime, and that I can send my messages and see when they have been seen, unlike my phone. I use it mostly on my Kindle Fire.
0,Facebook is a total aft about letting Fb messenger and Fb in general to work on Amazon products like the kindle, and the fire phones. Besides the messenger is a bunch of balony anyway regardless with too much mess ups which was the reason i got rid of it over 2 years ago. Its not worth going through the frustion of this app unless you got patience and a pot of gold.
1,I like messenger pretty well, but ever since I installed it, it seems to have done something to my game notifications. I don't know for sure if it affected them, but it seems that way. I do like it though.
0,Do not use Facebook. Don't want to be found. Don't need the attention. Facebook for a lot of people who need, or want attention. I'm not that insecure. I know where I stand. One star for the insecure book
1,Wish I had written down my password/& corresponding e-mail address. I need help to connect to facebook/messenger!!!' Plz? Have some one plz help me through this embarrassing time restarting on facebook FRIENDS: fun &messenger plz !
1,Though I wish there was better customization I find this app very useful for keeping in touch with friends and family. Very easy to use even my aging grandmother uses it with ease. Also I absolutely love the stickers and the variety of stickers available.
0,Messenger will no longer open on my fire hd 4th generation. I can also barley hear when I receive a message or incoming call. Amazon did not add an option to turn up notification volume and there is only one slider for media volume and Amazon notification. So can you please change this so that way you can hear the notification. Just would turn it up but there is no way.
1,I like this Kindle version much better than the one for my iPod. The layout is easier to see and use, and the "chat heads" let me know when a new message comes without interrupting what I'm doing.
1,Of course I love it!!
1,I use it all the time
0,Nice to hear everyone
1,Fast and easy to use.
1,fun to talk to people
1,It works pretty good.
0,Could be better print
0,Screwed up my Kindle.
1,I think it's great!!!
1,I am loving this app.
1,I downloaded this as soon as it came out for my kindle. The quality of the app is a good as it gets. there have been a few updates since that fixed all the bugs. it's really easy to use and convenient as it allows you to search for your friends list from facebook as you would in your computer. you can still use the swipe key board on your kindle. i've also used the face chat feature on it and it works just fine. Since my kindle doesn't have a camara it doesn't allow my to use face tim. With the new kindle is update Facebook messenger one runs chat heads smoothly which is a big plus for multi tasking. over all it is a great app and compared to it's competition it is as good as it gets as it is simple, useful, and reliable.
1,It is a nice app, allows you to talk to people easily. I love how the chat pops up in the corner and this allows me to stay in my current app while still responding to a message.
1,This app work fine with my Kindle Fire HD 7", I get my messages instantaneously, the only problem is that the little ding tone is delayed. The message pops up before the sound, when they should be simultaneous. I wish they would upgrade every week like the android app does, this is an older version. All in all the app works fine. I like it
1,I don't see what everyone is talking about when they say that this app don't compatible with the kindle fire because this app works perfectly fine for mine! Any way awesome app you should really get it.
0,No updates on this phone. Pretty disappointing
0,the app works properly with my Android phone. I would have given it five stars, but it drops a 'message notificaiton' button on my screen that is there all the time, and it gets in the way of using my phone.
0,There is new version but you didn't update your app store ??? you let us down and forgot us... if you don't care about your customers and don't want to add and upgrade applications on your app store let us install Google play ?????
0,I have an old version of the app because the app store won't let me update. The messenger app reminds me to update but when I press update it takes me to the app store and says no update available.
1,Every so often I download this app just to see if it will work. Today I successfully downloaded it to my kindle!!! Which is a huge deal since all my friends live in another state now and the actual fb app doesn't show my messages in the notification bar!!! So I'd you have been waiting to use it, try to get it in your kindle fire now!
0,It works on my fire for a day, updates, then just doesn't work. I've had to go back and reinstall it ever day so it works! Its starting to make me very mad. I have all my stuff updated to where it should, and still it happens. Please fix this stupid glich, its really annoying!
0,No pop up/ push notice on Fire HDX or Fire phone, so unless you "hear the beep" you do not know you have a message. If you do happen to hear the FB pop clicking the notification does nothing, you have to actually open the app (even if it says chat head is open) to see who/what the message is.
1,We use Facebook Messenger both to communicate with groups of friends on FB and for short texting when WiFi is available, but cellular service is unreliable. We like that the messages are stored until the recipient is in broadband coverage, so we don't miss messages like we do on Sprint texting.
1,Got this for my kindle. Pros: -When turned on, it alerts you of friends sending you messages. -You can quit the program when not needed or to remove distractions on your screen. Cons: -Floating bubble icons can get in the way sometimes or hard to remove.
0,If I could give this a minus 1 star I would. It half downloaded but won't open or even allow me to delete it. Really makes me angry because it used to work prior to the latest &#34;update.&#34; Sad because I used to use it often.
1,I love this new way to get in touch with my daughter who lives in a place that has poor reception with her mobile phone. I think it is a great way to talk to our facebook friends and family when you cant seem to reach them the conventional way.
1,I use this daily, I mean who doesn't right? I love it. My only complaint is not being able to access my other folder, very very annoying. With all the garage sale sites on Facebook nowadays its necessary to be able to see messages who aren't from friends a little more conveniently.
0,When I first installed the app, it worked great. It ran smoothly and I had very few issues. Then about 5 hours after downloading, my kindle was glitching it started to overheat. I hadn't made any other downloads after that, so I found that strange. I checked my virus app and it turned out that this app was the problem. I deleted it immediately and never redownloaded it. If whatever bug or virus was removed, I'd consider using it again. **note: this was on a kindle fire
1,It does what it's supposed to do. The only issue I have with it, and is pissing me off terribly, the call button is in the top right corner, and I constantly hit it accidentally, while swyping. Idk why it has to be on the screen at all? Smh. I've only been using it a few days, so I might find other issues later on, but at least it works.
0,The Amazon Fire phone version works but has way less features then I had using my Samsung Galaxy phone. You can't post to a specific group. There's no little face bubble when someone messages you. You can reply to IMs from Facebook only from a separate messenger.
1,I have this on my phone, and on my Kindle. It's easy to use, and much faster then, using the old way. It's nice to have when you're letting your phone charge, or you need a bigger screen! If you use Facebook a lot, I would get messenger, cause it's so much easier to use, then the old way, and let's you reply faster! The only problem I really had, was when I went to download it for the first time on my Kindle, it did take a few minutes to load, and to start working. After that, works fine, and I love it!

0,having to download a seperate app to use facebook properly is ridiculous. waste of space
1,It work for my kindle perfectly but the fact I don't get my messages in time.. Sometimes
0,How inconsiderate to invite me to try a new app that won't work on my fire phone. Rats!
1,You couldnt do anything to have made it any better. It was an ingenious thing to invent!
1,Indeed a good app, a little slow though and wishing for stickers to be available to use.

0,It is okay.
0,The chat heads don't work, but I still like how it makes noise when I get a message.. needs improved :)
1,Ill love that it would have some cool stuff like tango when video calling...some filters and fun stuff
0,Constantly running even when rarely used. Drains battery and eats up too much data and space on phone.
0,Microsoft says they are going to retire messenger so for that reason alone I have choose not to use it
1,Keeps t h e brain active. Great on long trips. Sometimes I need to take a break and come back to it.
0,Don't like bubbles popping up whenever I'm doing something...discontinued it...just not for me is all!
0,I don't get it. I've reinstalled three times and all I ever get is loading...never finishes the login.
1,this app me like because I'm txt for me friends Andre call the this countries and I have. one families
1,I don't know what the fuss is all about? I'm on my kindle fire right now and this app works perfectly.
1,It is almost necessary now to have this ap because of Facebook. But it works well and I use it a lot.
1,I don't understand how other people's kindle fire hd don't work with messenger but mine has been working all this time! I'd give it 9999999999 stars if I could
0,This app was working great but now any video on my timeline or video link won't play at all. It loads then goes right to the end of the video. Very annoying!!!
1,Thank you. The Product was exactly as described and arrived quickly. Thank you for an easy pleasant transaction, Great Product. I highly recommend this Seller!
0,I haven't used it on my Kindle Fire HD. But I used it on my Android, until I uninstalled FB. Works great. Too bad Facebook is such a memory hog for Android.
0,Amazon app store is ages behind Apple store and play store!! No video call option in this application but it is available in other platforms since many months.
0,It's hard to believe that all of these new and intrusive permissions are to improve the app. Reading messages that exist on other apps won't fix existing bugs.
0,First of all, massager can see or hear you at any time, kind of like it's spying on us. 2 of all it always crashes down. I wouldn't get this app if I were you.
0,The Chat Heads dont even show up and when you press where the chat heads should be the tablet freezes and just overall this app is terrible for the Kindle Fire
1,Very nice! Several of my 'friends' appear to be using Messenger. I really don't know how it is any different from the instant messenger we have on FB already.
1,I like it because you can see if you have a message from someone when you sign on, but I would like to know how to delete a conversation at the end of the day
0,Right now I'd like to get rid of it. It has popped up on my Kindle and I can't get rid of the message. Can't find a place to close or delete it and it floats around on my screen and when I'm trying to open something else it gets in the way and reopens the message. I joined it because my son recommended it to me but so far I fail to see the advantages of it. I can get private messages on my facebook or my email. This thing, so far to me, has been an annoyance.
0,I find it very difficult to use Messenger with my Kindle Fire tablet. It is not possible to forward photos to other friends even though one of the choices on the pull down screen is "forward". I tried adding a friend several times and always ended up adding some stranger I have no knowledge of...Never got my friend added, etc. Information on "help" feature ends up being a quasi-blog of other members offering suggestions on how to solve problems....most of which are useless pieces of advice.
0,Sucks
1,Easy to use and having the little icons display, gives it a nice touch.
1,I don't understand what every other comment is about but it works fantastic on my kindle. Facebook did a good job to make it compatible for my kindle. Maybe everyone else's aren't working with it. Idk what the problem is but I hope it works for everyone else just as well as it does for me.?????
1,All you people saying it don't work on kindle get yourself a fire tablet 7 5th generation and works perfect better than the kindle on Amazon store right now for 49.99 which is a amazing deal prime members get free two day shipping just got mine a week and a half ago love it
0,This gets one star from me because it won't acknowledge my Facebook password so I can't use it. And yes, I did enter the right password, several times. Also, requiring the use of an app is superfluous because I've been using messenger anyway through Facebook and I don't need my life to be this complicated.
1,Facebook messenger is great! It's a free way to stay in touch with your friends and family without having to use up your text messages for those who have a limit. You are notified immediately when you receive a message just like a text message if you choose to get the push notifications. I would definitely recommend it!
0,This worked fine on my Kindle fire up until a few moments ago. They said that an update was available so I updated it. Now it won't load anymore. Fix this and I will fix my rating. Until then it's a 1. Poor service to say the least.
0,it was working great two days ago. Now it won't open or function. I downloaded it maybe 5 days ago. I get a white screen and my kindle goes back to my home page. Doesn't matter if I restart my tablet it still does not open. I really want this to work.
1,It's efficient and easy to use.
1,Looking forward to improvements
1,Helps stay in touch with family
1,I use this app almost everyday.

0,Why is it that this app doesn't work well, your devices are running Androis Os with a heavily customized skin overlay but that doesn't mean you can't get it to work correctly..
0,I downloaded this app but it won't install in kindle fire. just don't waste your time thinking bout owning this app because it just cannot be installed in kindle fire first gen

1,Works like it should.
0,I don't use it often.
0,Didn't work on kindle
0,I'm old too confusing
0,I find it super annoying that to switch between accounts you have to uninstall completely (on a kindle fire). For basic function. it works.ok.
0,It would be nice to be able to completely close it down or log out. I don't like that it's constantly running in the background collecting data >: (
1,Now that this app is not spamming me to invite my friends I like it a lot better. All messages and stickers work and its faster than checking it from FB
0,If I could leave 0 stars I would. For some reason, this app stopped my kindle fire from working, so, next time I turned the fire on, I removed the app.
1,I use the messenger and it works for me but you have to have Internet to use it. In bad reception areas you can't access it and it takes a lot of data.
1,I love Facebook Messenger!! It makes it very easy and convenient to talk to people on Facebook. It instantaneously sends and lets you recieve messages.
1,Due to the changes with FaceBook chat, I had to download this app to see my friends messages when I wasn't on my laptop. It allows me to keep in touch.
1,Grateful Kindle offers this app , 4 me it's a necessary app, I have family I don't get 2 C but I can use this app 2 B in touch with family & friends.
1,It's straightforward messenger and works great. You can keep your chat heads for your friends on the screen, although some applications will remove it.
1,Glad this came out for Kindle,now I can text friends from that. Works great on my fire. Don't let all the bad press fool you Facebook is not spying you
1,I have a kindle fire, and it works just fine. Weird.. I
1,This app worked very well. Why is everyone complaining?

0,Facebook Messenger downloaded fine on my Kindle but would not open. Deleted it! Wanted to give it 0 stars but had to give it a 1.
1,The best thing about this app is that it I can use it with my cell or instead of my cell. Easy way to stay connected with friends
0,It is very obnoxious to force us to download an app that takes up memory on our tablets and phones and is completely unnecessary!
1,I think that Facebook messenger is a good app because it makes it easier and faster to message people than going through Facebook
1,I like the personal messaging option when I want to send a message to a friend. It is easy to understand and convenient to use.

0,I have a kindle fire HD and I used to have no problem with it but starting yesterday it keeps crashing whenever I go to use it

0,It needs to be updated I had the latest update on my old tablet and it was a lot better than the update on this.
0,don't like it. Actually had to remove it.. I don't need to be pinged every time someone posts to my FB account.
1,I love this game. Keeps my granddaughter busy for hours. I wish you gave out more coins and other thing to play.
0,You all need to hush it's not Amazon's fault that facebook hasn't made facebook messenger for the kindle fire HD
0,Really?! Every time I open a chat it closes the app and when it does open my messages never send! This App sucks
1,I have put off a long time adding facebook to my day - it's a great way to stay in touch with family and friends
0,It closes and disappears whenever the kindle freezes, and sucks most of the time. But it can be good. Sometimes.
0,All of a sudden it just stopped working. I can't send or receive messages & all of my contacts are gone.... :(

0,I do not like Facebook Messenger. it is inconvenient and in my way. The app probably works as inttended. It is just intrusive!!!
0,My antivirus on my Fire phone caught a trojan when this was downloaded and instructed me to uninstall it. Very, very disappointed.
1,I love using Facebook Messenger because often I can reach my daughter better & faster instead of texting cause she is always on fb.
0,The chat heads doesn't pop up on the sides I have to exit out of the whole facebook app just to text someone Piz fix!!!!
1,Having the messenger app on my devices makes it easy and for me to check my messages without having to log into Facebook. I love it
1,Messenger is great. You don't have time to get on FB this is as uick and easy. I use it everyday to communicate with a friend in NJ
0,Poor excuse for a messenger! The app freezes up constantly! Don't waste your time downloading this app because it's total garbage.
0,I would give this a three star because it works right on my kindle but, u can't log off from it unless you switch off your kindle!!
1,I love having this app. It's more convenient to have it pop up on your screen then having to go to fb to see my instant messages.
0,It's not bad, it crashes a lot on my kindle fire hd, but it works. I have been able to talk to people when I didn't have my phone.
1,Nice app and good synchronization of chat between Facebook app and this one.
0,Is barely compatible with Amazon's Forked up Android but then again what is?
0,occasionally doesn't allow me to open messages, easier to go to the browser.
0,Only used it a few times , audio goes out , video locks up ant it shuts down
1,It's wonderful. Anytime I have a message on FB it tells me and who wrote it.
0,I am going to kill you and your family for taking my things you are a theft.
0,Won't load anything now that it updated yesterday... can't even use the app.
1,it is great and fast way to communicate with live ones, thanfull to creators
1,It's actually good and what I like about it.that's u can call and Video chat
0,This is a much clearer program than the previous Messenger. Love using this.
0,I just starting using this system
0,Drains battery! I got rid of it.
0,I'm still learning how to use it.
0,^^^ like I said nothing like that
1,Works very well on my kindle fire
1,I really use this a lot! Love it!
1,Works perfectly with my kindle 7'
0,Don't buy this. I made a mistake.
1,I like it. It's fast and private.
1,Had to delete,took to much memory
0,Only used it once since download this week. Better with than without on Kindle HDX8.9. Will complete review later.
1,Facebook Messenger for Kindle Fire HD works very well. I have not had any issues with bugs or crashing. It works much like the app on other platforms. I don't have a lot of background in Android/Kindle apps as an avid iPhone user, but I am pleased with the UI and execution of the app. It's free, give it a try.
1,I use Facebook Messenger as an alternative to text messaging. It is a fast and easy way to connect with family and friends. However, I was told it might not be very secure. So it's important not to share private information on here.
0,Though I'm not a fan of this app due to its required permissions, I find that the version that is in the Amazon app store is fully compatible with my Fire device. Sideloading of an updated version will, however, cause the app to cease functioning.
0,When it's working it's very convenient. I especially like the option to show it over a full screen app. However, it is very unstable and keeps trying to unsuccessfully update itself. Sometime it freezes. The sound works off and on.
1,Thomson in full gonzo mode - from his struggle with the book "Rum Diaries" to his various run ins with local law enforcement agencies,to his insane treatment of editorial deadlines. HST was a unique and eloquent disaster
1,I could go on Facebook with my Kindle but couldn't see or respond to FB messages until I downloaded this app. Now I can chat with my granddaughter and watch her 5SOS videos etc from this messenger without having to switch over to my computer or even go on Facebook. Love it!
1,This app runs well. It does it's job. Just wish I could get the actual Facebook app to go with it. Not sure why it's been unavailable for a month...
0,Had problems with it, could not video chat all make calls.
0,It works ok but it has an issue on the fire phone. When you try to launch chat heads, it freezes the phone for a few seconds (10 or so) and then doesnt appear to actually do anything. The rest of it seems to work ok though. I used the in app phone and called a friend and it worked great. Sound quality wasnt an issue at all.
1,Contact sent me a couple of gifs through gyphy gif app, conversation now crashes messenger. Can't delete conversation or gif, have uninstalled and reinstalled, still crashes.
1,This app is extremely organized. I love how there are many different ways I can share things with people other then just texting. As in photos, stickers, emojis, and texting.
1,It's always good to have a messenger especially on those times that you only want to communicate and don't want to see billions of posts on Facebook that doesn't make sense.
1,I like it but don't love it yet. My grand daughter move to Texas so I don't have her to show me all that I could be doing with messenger. I'm a senior so I will get it soon.
0,I hate the fact that it is making me download facebook or else I can't veiw messages from my phone or tablet. I had it once before and some weirdo sent me pictures of myself
1,Although I wish you didn't have to have the messenger app to send facebook messages it is overall a great app. The call quality of the facebook phone option is outstanding.
1,Several of my friends choose to communicate via Messenger and I enjoy receiving their comments. I also like the fact that I receive an audible tone when receiving a message.
0,do not like this app at all. If I need to talk with someone that much I will just text. It's like having to text message apps. Had about 1 day then deleted. Who needs it.
1,This app does work for kindle fire, but can not make calls correctly. I love this app and use it all the time. I find it very reliable and the stickers are a great addition.
1,I can talk to our son who is in Korea with the US Army. Very clear reception. This just wonderful. And it's free!!! Thank you for helping us keep in touch with our son.
1,Good Program

1,wonderful... keeps one connected!!
0,Can't get it to work on my kindle.
0,I can't find a way to turn it off, that bugs me. I'll probably uninstall it from my phone.
0,It seems to slow my kindle a bit, but I do like the convenience of having it w/o using FB.
0,It's hard to shut the program off. The X button keeps moving off the bottom of the screen
1,It works well, however the updates need to be in sync with androids updates for messenger.
0,Just use regular messaging. I only used this because I didn't have a friends phone number
1,This works so well,and it's a quick way to keep up with your friends, I would highly this.
1,I like that my pm's pop up on any other site I am on, so I can respond in a timely manner.
0,If my friends don't have the app, they can't respond to my message. Not a fan of this app.
1,This app has proven to be truly a convenience for communicating with my friends and family
1,It's a very fast and easy way to contact friends without costs friends all over the world.
1,There are many times you want to reach one individual with a private message. This is a great way to do that. Thanks for providing it.
1,You have to move the chat head to the left side of your kindle or tab now don't complain it dose not work just need to move it. Simple
1,Usually works great. A couple times though, it did not deliver messages for a couple of hours. I will definitely continue to use it.
0,Unlike others my kindle fire let me use this app. I am not sure why but it did i would recommend using this app it is super way to use
1,Overall a good messaging app but the only downfall is no video chat and the Facebook desktop video plugin has never worked regardless.
1,Pretty much the only complaint I have is that the icon has some imperfections that show up on the high res display of the Kindle Fire.
0,Downloaded just fine to my kindle, however he keeps saying that i have to manually update it and it won't let me...it still works tho
0,Kept comming up as a pop up. Not what I wanted at all. All I wanted to do was access my messages..not have to constantly peruse them.
1,I like it. I like the way the person sending you messages picture shows up on the screen and you don't have to go look for messages.
1,I don't get on Facebook much, but I do communicate with a few people through messenger. Works like a text, which is very convenient.
0,Y'all could go on Google and search up one mobile market. And then download it. Then you could download any app you want
0,I use it on kindle fire hd. The little bubble keeps going away without me telling it to and I'm starting to get annoyed.
1,I dont see what the problem is with other kindle fire HD's....Mine is working perfectly fine and I have a kindle fire HD
0,cant free call or use gifs. not cool at all. my daughter has this fire and j have an aneroid. so she cant send them back
1,Love this App. Works better than messenger as I live in the country and cell phone messaging doesn't always go through.
1,I'm 12 years old messenger is fun chatting I have 1million friends on Facebook thanks for creating this app over and out
1,Great messenger to integrate with Facebook. It does everything I seem to want it to do. Runs smooth on the Fire Phone.
1,I like this a lot. Very easy to use. My only issue is having 2 places to message just a bit silly. But I really like it!
0,I'm actually just getting started with it try to see what I can and can't do will have something better later to report
0,Video chat has a lot to be desired. I have an iPhone and iPad and the video drops often, but it's better than nothing.

0,Can't use with my fire. Stupid. Waste of time. Good job Zuck.
0,Buggy app but necessary to keep up on useless social updates.
1,Can play alone or challenge someone. Good for entire family.
0,Doesn't work on my Kindle, which I use for almost everything.
1,I love this app it works well on Fire but not on Kindle fire.
1,Excellent collection of Mr. Mailer's short works and interviews. Contains probably his finest essay on the arts , "A Faith in Grafitti". Always controversial and insightful, never boring.
0,I downloaded this app in hopes to use it on my Kindle Fire TV stick. Unfortunately, it's not compatible. Hopefully someday it will be. I would love to be able to use it via my Kindle Fire stick.
0,The app is probably good if you oh want to text. My goal was to videoconference. So far I cannot determine how to make those calls. Without the videoconferencing it's no different than FB.
0,It literally forces you to download it on your phone if you want to view messages, it should just be part of the FB app. Plus the bubble pop up is annoying as hell. I uninstalled it immediately.
1,Great app. Alows me direct contact with my Facebook people. I had it on a diff. smart phone, so as soon as I got hooked up with another plan, & phone I made sure this app was on my screen again.
1,I use it daily. Often to much . It's enjoyable for me to be able to chat and share pictures . And create a family group.. Some of my family doesn't utilize Messenger,so I seldom hear from them.
0,An annoying, pain in the butt program. I don't know why FB insists on having a stand alone program like this. I uninstalled it shortly after initial use. A complete waste of time. Dew
1,I love the way the interface is set up, and they even separate those of your friends who are on messenger from those who are just online on Facebook. It's a win beer how such a great app is free
1,U can do what you want but when you try to call someone it get all staicki on a speakers but if it is all alone u can't hear a single thing the people that own this app needs to fix it a little.
1,I use it on my phone, so it's also nice to have it on my Kindle Fire. Disappointed that my Facebook just went away though. The app disappeared from my Kindle and no new Facebook app is offered.
1,some times it want let sign in. when I can I really like it.
1,Great way to keep in touch with friends and family privately
1,I have never had a problem with it not even with the photos.
1,It's was great to see the people that you talk to ,loved it.
0,I use it for the convenience, but it murders my battery life
1,Very good application, works perfect with Amazon Fire phone.
1,it works great it runs really smoothly for me its amazing :D
1,Operates way better for my LG3 than the actual Facebook app.
1,Good but often drops,calls and such,fix and would be perfect
1,Love talking to friends and the characters they have to use.
1,Good game. Moved from 7 inch to 8.9 inch fire hdx. Used game code so did not have to start game over. Still playing.
1,It makes personal "conversations" easy & private. It's fast & easy to use, which is a defendant plus for me.
0,Just wish it would sync with my phone and laptop, to realize to cancel a notification when I already read a message.
0,It does not work properly. The chathead is not enabled and end up being something annoying on the Amazon Fire Phone.
0,No doesn't work why is it even possible to download if y'all know it doesn't work you must be over 13 to make an app
1,I like messenger I'm new to it and I think it's a really good thing I will be using it often from now on thank you.
1,Real great to use this. When anyone msgs me, it gets my attention instead of going thru FB to see any msgs for me.
1,I like messenger better than facebook . It is easy to use for people just begining to send messages back and forth.
1,Use it all the time with family members that don't text! Who doesn't text, you may wonder - my 72-year-old mother!
0,Full of SPYWARE and MALWARE.... but is the only way to use messaging in Facebook..... Got us by the Balls AGAIN !!!

1,I like it. I wish I could add photos to my messages
1,Great way to get all of your messages in one place.
1,Easy to see that I have a message when on my kindle
0,I don't like it but we have no choice with Facebook
1,I like it really like it works on my kindle firehd6
1,It works fine on my kindle. Am I missing something?
0,I don't see the point and it puts up images you cannot remove. An image of my mistress was stuck on my Kindle and my wife is furious. I had to remove the app. I will sue you if my wife goes for divorce.
0,I've used this app on almost all platforms (Apple, Android, Windows, etc) but this one is certainly the worst. I use it on my Fire phone and each time I tap the drop down notifications it freezes the entire phone and I have to restart it. Also, there's the fact that the chat bubbles do not function on any screen except the in-call screen... Because that's really user-friendly right? ?
0,I was tryin to download this and it keeps sayin that it wont install because the app has been corrupted. This is on the kindle fire and I dont know why it says its corrupted. I downloaded this fine on my moto e phone, why wont it download on kindle fire. It makes no sense.
0,Slow, buggy. Way too big. Don't want two fb apps on my phone. Tried to msg FB from Messenger about my displeasure with Messenger, but the msg never sent. Uinstalled.
0,When in the Facebook app for fire you cannot directly access the Messenger app for Fire phone. When pressing the messenger icon in Facebook the Messenger app will not automatically populate. Instead it freezes up the Fire phone.
0,If I could give zero star, I would. It is horrible and invasive. I couldn't stand seeing it in every other application I opened in kindle. I had to de-install it after about 12 hours. I guess that it depends on a person. I just hate the fact that the app showed up every where, like get out of my face and my life already.
0,Would give 0 out of 5 if it were possible. Not only was this a mandatory download, but once I installed it it repeatedly caused my phone to crash. Those issues aside, you cannot reach friends that don't also have the messenger app and if a friend shares a media format that is incompatible with messenger, you will not be able to open that conversation without crashing both messenger or Facebook. Thanks to this latest in a long string of inefficiency, I say to both Facebook and Amazon, good day. I am going back to an Android phone.
1,I like that I can use this app without having to quit the program I am on and actually go to Facebook to chat with my daughter who lives 1300 miles away. I use my kindle a lot at night and it is a real handy app.
0,I have deleted and reinstalled this app quite a few times. I recently tried to uninstall it and it refuses to do so. Since it wouldn't uninstall, I tried seeing if I would still be able to use it. It won't open and so I must use the online version. It also glitched out my text so that when i type it lolooks lilike thithis.
1,I installed this program earlier this evening on my Kindle Fire HDX and I have been messaging with several people since then with no problem. I was reading a book and the messenger icon popped up, when I tapped on it it took me straight to the facebook message site. I have not had the opportunity to see what else is available or how it works with my Kindle Fire so I only gave it four stars.
1,I really like this.
1,Great. Useful tool.
0,No advantage to me.
1,I like it very much
0,can't figure it out
1,I think it's great.
0,Always freeeeeerrze
1,Wonderful and free!
1,I thing it's great.
1,Great app...love it
0,The app pops whenever someone sends a message my way and it gives me headaches, I go to mute my notifications but it still pops, and I can't turn them back on now that it actually muted them a few minutes ago
0,It suddenly won't work, it cut out the home, back and favorite button from the bottom of my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to delete from Kindle then download again but all I get is a black screen and a message saying 'MESSENGER NOT RESPONDING.' and I close it only to try again and get the same message. I deleted it from cloud AND made space on my kindle fire for it, STILL met with a black screen and the message it won't respond.
0,How about making this compatible with Kindle Fire!?!
1,I love how people are saying it doesn't work with kindle but it works perfect with mine
0,I have the kindle HD8 (5th generation). I have always had an excellent experience with fb messenger app on many devices... until this one. Every time I click on it, it goes to a blank screen and takes me back to home screen. If I tried to open it via fb app, it would make the whole app freeze then take me back to home screen. It does not open whatsoever. I think maybe if I used a different browser it might work using a diff browser and not using any app...
1,I downloaded this program to my Kindle Fire HD 7 4th Generation and easily called Germany from USA. It sounds just as good as calling from my cell phone. I tried using the video function on my kindle, but it keeps saying "Unavailable at this time". The video function works fine from my laptop computer.
0,This app is great for just contacting your Facebook friends without having to go through the main app or the website. It gets the job done and when the push notifications were working I was satisfied.
1,I have an older kindle fire hdx and it works fine most of the time freezes up one Jen awhile but. Just close my fb screen then open it again and usually works fine, once or twice I had to shut down my kindle and restart power. My only issue is that a lot if times the chat bubbles of my conversations cover the send button.
0,It installed just fine but I couldn't find my friend and she couldn't find me so ultimately it was a fail. I've heard others say it doesn't install with a kindle fire but in my case I it was the lack of functionality that disappointed me.
0,I don't like this app. I took it off my phone and now I will take it off my tablet. When I am reading or playing a game, the messenger bubbles will pop i up. While some people may like that, I find it very annoying.
1,Glad Amazon has this Genuine App. A must have for all Androids.
1,Good when I ever figure out how to use correctly on Kindle fire
1,It's cool. I just didn't want to download it. Damn you Facebook

1,I give this app 5 stars lol I feel bad for the people who don't even have enough money to buy a tablet compatible with this app. Oh well lol
1,It allows people who have a Facebook account but don't get to get on it because there parents don't let them,this allows you to do that
0,Hard to get out of the app after sending messages. Have a picture up in right corner that does not go away unless I delete the message.
1,Some of the upper levels are frustratingly difficult, but it's so satisfying once you beat them! I can't get enough of this game.
0,Y NOT MAKE IT KINDLE FIRE DUMB @*&%# LIKE THE @#$% ARE U @#$%&* DUMB LIKE MAKE ONE KINDLE FIRE BEFORE I BEAT YALL &$%

0,Video not working, fix it
1,Great way to chat offline
1,im not talking about this
0,I do really like the way this is set up and how easy it is to navigate. But I HATE that it doesn't hardly ever let me know that there is a pending message request or "filtered" request. I do a lot of buying and selling on Facebook, so this is particularly annoying to me since I have odd people messaging me at all times of the day. And I still have no idea how to go and check your filtered messages from this. I wish facebook would stop with the stupid filtering anyways, but I would at least like a notification that its there. Annoying.
0,I love the Facebook Messenger app...but for my Kindle Fire HD 7, I don't love it so much. I'm currently giving it a 3-star rating because the chat heads part crashes every single time I am using the app. It is not that the app crashes or freezes. It is that the chat heads disappear. And then I have to hunt down the actual app and retype what got lost when the chat head disappeared. I think if this problem gets fixed, my rating would improve, because otherwise, I am happy with the app. The disappearances are a huge problem for me, though.
0,What can I say, other then being so intrusive this app and Facebook just intrude Iin your life like a crazed ex girlfriend.if you read the permissions thou accept at the next update you will see what I'm talking about.went would you need to turn on my microphone or read my text messages or turn my camera on.I don't allow these two apps on any of our tablets or phones in my house.I don't even want to give one star.
1,I like not having to log into facebook just to view messages. I like that when I get a new message it pops up my kindle fire home screen and I can just click the picture and open the conversation with nothing else to distract me away from what I'm doing. I can respond and go back to my activities. I don't need to leave another app or game I'm in either. I love that I can just open the conversation and reply and than close it and automatically go back to where I was in my game.
1,ignore the year old reviews saying it doesn't work on kindle fire hd, because it does now (and has for a while). personally i love the Facebook messenger and I'm very pleased i can get it on my kindle fire. the messenger itself is fun and stylish. i swear there is a emoji sticker for your every mood. lol the stickers are a lot of fun. only problem i have had so far is that when the new message bubble pops up it sometimes leaves part of the bubble stuck on the screen and its very annoying and i have to restart my kindle to remove it. and in case you did not know, you can not use the calling functions from your kindle. (duh)
1,I am very dependent on this app. Because I lived in a foreign nation for two years, this app allows me to frequently communicate with those I love on a day to day basis. It is easily accessible and since it is free, it is a must have for your mobile device. I have a difficult time listing any negative comments about this app. Pros: this application does an astounding job of keeping track of past conversations you have had it with your friends on Facebook. You can quickly recall any previous conversations and continue communication with either individuals or groups. Facebook has allowed you to use certain Emoji's and gifs which add a fun twist to this application. The app loads quickly and after many months I have never had a single crash issue. I also use this app to communicate with my friends in other states. Cons: as I said before, it is difficult for me to list any negative comments about this app. One thing that may be be frustrating is the fact that those who you are chatting with will appear on your tablet or mobile device despite not having the application open. This is not a big deal, but can be annoying because sometimes their profile picture will be in the way of things you're trying to tap or click. Other than this I have no troubles with this app.
1,OMG, I wonder what I ever did without this! I moved to an island from CA and thought I might lose touch with important people in my life. Not so with Facebook Messenger app. I never miss a message now and do not have to go online to the full Facebook page to see if anyone contacted me. It's a real blessing because some friends are having health issues and some are in relationship crises and I can offer immediate support to them with this app.
1,It works perfectly fine. People are saying it only works on the Fire Phone but it's working AMAZING on the Kindle Fire. I can have a chat head open while I'm in another app, and if it gets in the way I can drag it down below and make it disappear. I can also instead of going to the app I can swipe down the menu screen and click 'Start A New Chat Head', and it automatically opens open in your app. Then, when you're done your other app is still 'under it' and ready for use. I love the Facebook Messenger application. It's great for people who don't get on FB and just want to chat. If you're looking for FB as well I recommend the regular FB app.
0,I downloaded the app so I could talk to friends while my cell phone was on the charger. This works for that the only problem is that if I go to long using the app on my phone it severely slows down me Kindle when I eventually use it.
1,Being face book decided to update , confused me during a chat session I thought I would give this messenger a try . Reading most reviews stating it doesn't work on fire kindle ( Course those reviews were overr a yr ago), I still wanted to try. Glad I did ! I don't always wish to be on my fAce book wall but I do have friends and family who use the IM portion of Facebook Instead of yahoo or kik. This works well for me and my kindle is a fire HDX.
1,Love it...great ay to communicate "live"

1,Does what it promises. Works fine in my Fire Phone
0,Glitches sometimes, but overall it's nice to have.
1,Makes me really think a lot. I have a Kindle Fire. Works great. Wish it wasn't so much for a hint. They get ya there, just want your money. Otherwise a good game.
1,My wife was in Aruba. Made it nice to communicate without breaking the bank ($$$$$$). This is an acceptional program for communication when away from home.
1,I am very happy with the app so far, I was happy that I was able to speak to my Mom overseas. I do like using this app to stay connected to my friends and family.
0,This app is super bad! Everytime I enter the app it tats blank for a while and then it says: Messenger is not responding. It is so stressful! DO NOT GET THIS APP.
1,It is great, especially because all it requires is that you are a Facebook user. I had doubts that it wouldn't work between Android and other systems but it does.
1,I Downloaded this for my kindle fire HD it works great. No problems so far. Get yours today. I am not sure why people say it doesn't work on kindle it does mine.
0,Incompatible with Amazon Fire phone. Need to fix this. I tried to update Nd the update fails. All I get is a white and then the app crashes. This is ridiculous.
1,With how many comments about how the messenger app isn't compatible, I'm actually kind of shocked that it works so well on my kindle. Downloaded and works great!
0,I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THAT FACEBOOK IS ALL UP IN YOUR BUSINESS WANTING SO MUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION AND I DON'T WANT MY PHONE NUMBER AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE TO GRAB.
0,Had a difficult time understanding person trying to resolve issue's. She didn't speak clear enough to understand what she was referring to. Very confusing reply.
1,Facebook Messenger communication is quick and convenient...can communicate with Australia (and other places) without going through the facebook notifications.
1,This App Is Amazing! ! I Can Text My Friends &&' Whenever I Want &&' Idk But I Just Think Its A Really Good App &&' I Just Enjoy It :D
0,Why isn't it updated
1,Yep, I'd rate it, 10
1,Works great on my phone and my fire. I don't care too much for my 'loss of privacy' that many harp on this app for, because frankly I'm not that interesting.
1,This is a nice app for your tablet. Send and receive private messages to your friends. You can also send pics. If you are on Facebook you need Messenger too.
1,It has been helpful in keeping in touch with my son who has mental health problems while I work. I use wifi in most pkaces I travel to....best thing to use.
1,Fun, convenient... have had no troubles using on my December 2013 Kindle Fire.... GREAT app, probably one of my top picks for most useful of the year (2015)!
0,Keeps hanging up on people, connection isn't good even though excellent internet connections going to keep trying, will up date this if starts working better
1,I'm a first time user of fb and have so far been able to connect with family and friends very easily. It's a wonderful tool for staying in touch with others.

1,love it let me keep in touch with family and friends!!!!!
1,Works well its depending on the speed of your connection.
1,Haven't had much time to use it but it appears to be fine
0,I hate my kindle and do not understand it at all so I am having my son remove everything from it and I am going to sell it. I do not understand the messenger thing at all and the whole thing is way too complicated for me. I got it for Christmas and have not used it once. Hate it.
1,Since I downloaded this twice, after my son mistakenly uninstalled it once, I've NEVER had any problems with it. It's an easy app to use so I'm not sure why/how someone would have issues with it. It's never crashed, or had difficulty opening. If you have problems maybe it's not the app but the user.
0,Well finally Facebook realized that it forgot about Kindle users, so I got happy that the app showed up in the store. My happiness was not long. Have you even tested the app on Kindle? Do you realize that we cannot send files or other things? Plus when you click on the Facebook app to chat someone, it does not open the Messenger like it does on the phone. Fix the flaws first, test it, fix more flaws, test, etc... and only then publish your app and make people use it. It's very annoying otherwise.
0,The app is more of a necessary evil than help. It was better to message inside Facebook. I only use it because others reach out through Messenger. The app performance on the Fire tablet is spotty, with latency and sometimes connectivity issues when everything else is working.
1,There are lots said About privacy issues with messenger, but I feel like if you don't have anything to hide, any does it matter?! Facebook is connected to millions of people and those that don't have a phone are without a way to call their friends and family. Messenger makes that possible FOR FREE! Not only that, it's essentially free texting too. I think it's wonderful that people have have an option!
0,I got it on kindle fire, and it worked pretty well. It was a little slow, but fine. But every few months it made you renew your account, that means just typing in your password. Well I forgot my password, I didn't get why you needed it. My fault, I guess. Pretty nice though, you can send pictures, stickers, videos, and voice clips. Works well on IPhone.
1,Can't update on kindle fire he. Anybody else???
0,Bloatware. That's all I have to say. No reason to force this on users as the original integrated messaging system worked fine unless they want to get more personal info and just generally slow down your device. Also strangely hard to completely uninstall. Shady and wrong.
1,I love this. This is perfect for us especially we are planning to travel outside the country soon. Easy to use and put pin on it... pedfect for our luggage. I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange of my.honest review.
1,This app works great on the Kindle. Its the only way that you can get your facebook messages on mobile devices so if you are going to be using Facebook and wanting to have access to any messages or messaging functions, you are going to need to download this app.
0,It's an APP...it works....what more can I say.
1,Cutest magnets ever made well highly recommend

I like this app,,I may keep it,!! :-) :-),,2 smiles rate,!!
1,For everyone who says they are having compatibility issues, you need to have your kindle fire updated to Fire OS 4.1.1. Once you do that, Messenger works just as it should.
1,I truly NEED this app, as I have no cell service where I live. With Messenger, I am able to talk to my kids in college, and away, every day. I don't have to wait until I'm in town to call. Instead I can talk by typing or voice call. Almost everyone I know has a fb account, so it comforts me that I can get ahold of people, and then me, at any time. The settings help you to set level of privacy and turn on/off location. One thing fb got right.
1,Big fan of Facebook Messenger! It is so nice to be connected without having to be on Facebook and exposed to that insipid news feed in order to get to any messages. I'm a newbie to Messenger (got a link to install it from a friend just this month) but the more I use it the more I like it. Thanks to Amazon for making it available on the Kindle Fire!
0,I use this on two separate Fire devices (phone and tablet), and on both of them it works erratically -- and mostly, just doesn't work. For some reason, it continually asks to sync my contacts and phone number -- then logs out and says "Try again." I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Facebook itself works fine, but this does not, which means that I have no way to respond to messages in Facebook, rendering Facebook a broken experience.
1,This app is really good and helps me talk to all my Facebook friends.
0,Do not down load this onto your phone or ipad or what ever until you have read through what this program has access to. After reading everything the program can get to I stopped the down load. Regardless, Amazon still thinks I have this app so it may still be on my phone somewhere. You don't get the access information until the program in on you phone.
0,I miss not having the right side sliding feature that showed who was on line on FB in the old app. There are no instructions on how to block others or hide myself from others when I don't want to be bothered. I wish FB techs will stop making changes for things that were not broken to.begin with. It's like they are trying to justify their the existence of their jobs.
0,This app doesn't open on my Fire and causes the device to freeze for about 30 seconds. It works on my android phone but the furthest it gets on the Fire is a white screen with no content. I will gladly re-review if an update comes that fixes this.
0,I didn't like it because I was constantly being interrupted by messages from Facebook on my phone. Even after they told me how to delete it I was still getting messages from Facebook. The only way I could get rid of the messages was to delete my cell phone number from Facebook. I guess it is ok for someone who lives on Facebook, but I don't.
0,good app. Will continue using it, wish it had smaller memory footprint..but would use it if I liked facebook.
0,Buggy, constant issues, a real drag. Facebook needs to keep messaging incorporated in one app. Poor all round
1,Video calls do not work perfectly but it's a great way to talk to family and friends that do not have Skype.
0,nightmare on a Fire phone. Constant notifications that were hard to get rid of, I ended up deleting the app.
1,Am not much for instant messengers, but this one works well. Am using it on my Kindle, and it is convenient.

1,Had no problems at all.?
0,Does not work with fire!
1,Not as easy to navigate.
1,Absolutely wonderful??
0,not a fan that i had to download messanger. it was not always like that as there are people that are on my list that dont have this app. and i dont use FB on my phone. I am not getting anything "notifying me" of messages i get, or maybe i just havent gotten any yet? not a fan i guess
1,Wonderful to have! It alerts me anytime someone messages me making it much easier. I'm not a frequent Facebook user, so normally I don't realize I've been messaged until several days later. With this to alert me though, I am now able to respond to people in a much more prompt fashion and never need to worry if I should check Facebook or not.
0,I hate that you need an app that doesn't even work on my phone so I have to install it on my kindle just in case people want to communicate with me. Requiring this stupid app is my biggest First World Problem, so I can't really complain. But I do hate it.
0,After using this app on my phone I decided to put it my Kindle Fire. I then removed it because it has a small blue bar saying to tap on bubbles to see messages. Great if the blue bar would only show when a message actually popped up. I couldn't remove it and then I couldn't browse the internet. Once I took it off my device no problems
0,Does not work on the AMAZON KINDLE FIRE. Really ?????????
0,It was a good app up until about a week ago. I used to be able to view gifs on messenger that my friends sent with other applications. Every time I scroll over a gif now messenger force closes, or my Kindle restarts. This was fine at first, I just used my phone to go through and delete the gifs, but now it's constantly force closing when I try to open up a chat. Facebook Messenger is my main way of communicating with friends, so this is extremely annoying when I can't talk to anyone due to all the force closing.
1,I was skeptical about even getting a second Facebook app, but I quickly came to like this one a lot once I finally downloaded it. It works perfectly with my Amazon Fire phone. But Facebook, how about helping out our Kindle friends??
1,I've never used messenger until I got a Kindle Fire over the weekend. One of the first apps I downloaded was this one, and it works great. I love being able to connect with friends faster and not have to be on Facebook itself every time.
0,1: This app is actually compatible with the Kindle Fire. 2: I like the interface, it's smooth and straightforward. 3: It crashes too often. 4: I can't log out of my account through it... 5: Some messages take way too long to load.
0,When I open it my kindle just goes white and will stay white for eternity if you let it. I've redownloaded it twice and restarted the kindle as well. Other reviews say it doesn't work on kindle, but my sister has a kindle and it works for her.

1,Given all the nasty comments I didn't have much hope for this app on my fire. But it works great outside of having to sign in every time.
1,It is one the most important part of your own site and its so much easier to find what I'm looking for when I want to talk or give ideas!
1,It seems to work well, I don't use it as my main message system, you wanted me to rate the darn thing, I don't know what else to say!
0,Constantly hear an echo. Please fix that! Otherwise it's a great service that could potentially save people hundreds of dollars per year!
1,I don't know what everybody else is on about. This app works great on my kindle. The little chat head is up all the time and works great.
1,My Messenger is great on my kindle!! To all those who's don't work, maybe u just need a newer kindle. It works smoothly and it's amazing!
0,Messenger is the best way to communicate it's much faster pictures go thru where most times there is trouble with pictures when you text.
1,a must have for the adamant Facebook user.I have the same app for my smartphone...makes sense that I would get it for my tablet as well.
1,I love this app. I get a one on one message to exactly who I want as an IM on facebook. I'm still learning how to use it , terrific. :)

1,Messenger works on my kindle fire. It's slow starting up, but it still works. After kindles upgrade (2/13/2016), my messenger didn't work at all. So I uninstalled and reinstalled and it works now.
0,Glitchy. This program constantly crashes on the Kindle.
1,Works fine for me. Makes easier than login to Facebook
1,Love messenger. Easy to use and I use it all the time
0,It's sooo annoying because it doesn't let me use it
0,Doesn't work at all. Total junk! What a waste smh
1,Easy to use and locate friends and family easily
1,Use daily to communicate with family. Love it!
1,Love it. It makes so easy to get my messages.
1,The talking heads are nice. It took a bit to realize how to dismiss a head when the conversation has done. Does allow you to prioritize conversations.
1,I like this more than I thought I would. I especially like the signal when someone is messaging you. I also appreciate how easy it is to add pictures.
1,I only shop Amazon. I love the selections and how fast my orders get to me. I order electronics cloths and music. I find the best prices for my money.
1,Facebook Messenger is a very useful application to communicate and contact Friends on the web. Facebook Messenger Is An Excellent Communication Tool!
1,I am not a fan of having to download a separate application for messages on facebook, but this application works great for taking care of my messages.
1,I hate this so much lol this app is awesome yfudydtdt hgxtdtxg hfydhvjdeohtd qdzgophn hdhrhgth hfhtg dtxtggbg. gjujyhtivfu hcfyhtcghfvdwypjfj ofter th
0,The chat head either dont pop up or if they are up they crash and then I dont get notifications at all. I've tried uninstalling and nothing has worked
0,Well I think it is stupid and normal facebook was fine enough and this annoys me how u have to go to the separate app. Oh and it sucks on my kindle!!!
0,I don't think this should be necessary but, so I like how it is not on my tablet, but I have to have it on my cell now to read and reply to messages.
0,This popped up, we downloaded it. Now needs to update. Guess what Facebook, IT IS NOT KINDLE FIRE FRIENDLY! Can we get a fix that will actually work!
1,I use it to keep in touch with my younger son who's a good distance from home. Video messaging is the bomb and absolutely free through my WiFi! I'm looking forward to trying it with my daughter-in-law whose in Afghanistan.
1,I love FB Messenger because it is the best way for my daughter am I to communicate when she is out of the country. She can access it on phone, computer or tablet, so if she is hiking in Cambodia, or in a coffee house in Vietnam, she can reach me. I love that you can send images, screenshots, and emoticons. #FBMESSENGERFAN
1,I love the app Facebook Messenger for my Amazon Kindle. It heps me keep in touch with my facebook friends wherever I am at. I sometimes have my computer on and my tablet. I send my friends pictures that I have taken on my tablet through messenger. That is basically all I use it for. I like that it shows what friends I am having conversations with.
0,It works fine on my kindle, it's a bit buggy but nothing too bad, I'm not a fan of the latest update but it's something I'll get used to. The only major problem is that it won't notify you if the kindle's in sleep mode, but personally I have other devices that make a loud enough noise to be heard from any room, so not an issue.
0,4 months of out of date. Amazon really needs to work on the variety and actualization of the app store if you're gonna keep making Kindle Fire tablets and providing support for the few but invested Fire Phone owners.
1,Just got the messenger despite all the bad reviews on it. Figure I'd try if for myself, on my Kindle Fire HD. App loaded great, setup was easy. All the features are outstanding, easy customization and background messaging. All in all, excellent messaged for Facebook on Fire HD. Why the bad reviews?
0,It's been 5 stars for me since it first came out, but it's saying I need to upgrade but when I try, I can't. I have a Fire and it's not letting me upgrade. I would greatly appreciate it if you fixed it so those of us with the Fire can upgrade too. Then I would rate it 5 stars again!!
1,I know that a lot of people complained about the permissions FB wanted for this app, but I chanced it anyway and I am so glad I did. It is so convenient to have all my friends right there and it pops up on my phone or tablet as soon a I have a message. I love it.
0,Hate it, it's a pain in the butt to have to go to another app every time there's a new message. And my son, who is a young child gets very upset when peoples profile pictures pop up while he is watching his Disney movies...I plan to delete the app.
0,It would be great if it actually continued to work.. .when I install it, it works great for about a day, then it gives its out of network...I have to un-install then Re-install every day...I wish they would make it more comparable with KINDLEfire
0,I didn't like it

1,Been able to use messenger to talk to husband in the middle East. Works great he can see the family anytime.
1,I personally see nothing wrong with it, it's just like using the phone app. Works great, I recommend getting.
0,I hate it y Not a big fan of giving my private information out for something that's supposed to be free.

1,The recent reviews were correct but that was over a year ago and the messenger app has been updated thank you
1,Great way to sent a text, allowing the receiver to hear your voice at the same time. I really am enjoying it.
0,so annoying they split facebook into 2 apps - plus I hear FB messenger is not secure enough with your data :(
0,I think its fine because it works really well and u should try using it again its good! well ok not that good

1,I guess it used to not be compatible with kindle fires but it is now and it's great!
1,Facebook messenger is great! My whole family uses it to send messages to each other.
1,The ending was a little disappointing though. Maybe I was just sorry to have it end.
1,It's facebook so its got its flaws, but it works like IM or texting for your tablet.
1,Not sure how this is any different than private messaging when on FB, but I like it.
1,I use it all the time to contact people instantly or just to send a private message.

1,works need facebook and u will get to talk to people and u can text people and u wont get stocked
0,I am not sure how I even got this (didn't order it) and the reminders drive me crazy!
0,It's not horrible just don't see the point. Two apps that shouldn't need to be apart.
0,Hated it, Had to delete it completely to get rid of it and it still interferes!!!!

0,Like so much of the stuff I've downloaded I can't figure out how to use it!!!!! And do you EVER bother to monitor what goes on(usage) if a person doesn't use the product WHY THE HELL Would I want something I can't use????? It just clogs up my device
0,Using an Amazon Fire Phone. This app is super outdated. My phone has version 26 installed. Other appstores have a lot more recent versions of this app. And because this app is so outdated, I can't open chats in which people have sent content that only became available in later versions because the app force closes if they do. In other words, if they send me anything besides text, the app could close.
1,I have a kindle fire HDX and it is certainly compatible with my device. Some people say that it's not compatible with their kindle fire but it may be the type of kindle that they have. If they have the kindle HD then it may not work or be compatible with their device. Since it is compatible with my device then I would have to say that it works fine for me. Other people say that they want video chat. They now have it. You have to update your Facebook Messenger app to the newest version that they released June 14 2015. The app is amazing and you should definitely get it. But remember that you have to have a Facebook account in order to access this app. I would definitely recommend this texting app to others that have a Facebook account.
1,Fb message work very well on my kindle fire HD I've read some of the comments just about everybody is saying that it don't work on their kindle most of these messages are old so they must have up grade the fb message for kindle fire l have no problem with mines
1,Messenger is absolutely great! I use it daily to stay in touch with my friends and family. I do believe anyone who is anyone is on facebook these days. That makes messenger pretty much a necessity. The emoticons, along with the easiness of use is what makes messenger so great! They have a wide array of downloadable content that you can send to any of your friends. You can also have group conversations as well.. This is always fun! I would recommend messenger to anyone who has a facebook account and a smartphone or tablet. Stay in touch with those you love!
1,I love FB messenger. It's better than texting. Texting a long message can take more than one. The person gets the last part of the message first. Not good. With FB messenger, your message can be as long as you like.
0,It's bull, I was forced to download this to send and receive messages on facebook, and it keeps closing. It stays open long enough for me to see I have a message, but when I click on the messages to read them the app closes
1,The app all together is nice. It works like it's supposed to. I've noticed a lot of people said if they want to type an emoji or send a sticker, nothing pops up. I had this problem too. Just turn it sideways and it should work then. I'd give it 5 Stars if it let me send stickers up right instead of just sideways.
0,Okay, so I was reading the reading the reviews for this app, and everybody keeps saying it doesn't work with kindle fire hd, but I actually installed this app back when I first got my kindle. In December. It was compatible then. I uninstalled it due to problems. And when I installed it again, it's fine now. Okay, The notifications is pretty much the only issue I have. It doesn't show the chat icon for the side of the screen or give me any notifications what so ever, until 30 minutes later via email. So yeah.
0,Definitely NOT designed with the Kindle Fire in mind. It works but has serious problems with the way a Kindle OS functions. I'm forced to use it now the FB app took out messaging. So, at least I'm giving this app a horrible rating.
1,I like everything about this app except that even though I can have more than one Facebook account, I can only use this app for ONE unless I uninstall, then reinstall to log in with other acct.
1,This is 1 of the best APPS ever discovered..u can talk to anyone in a matter of a minute or less..if their online or close to a phone..but the person u r contacting has to have Messenger too...
1,I really enjoy FB Messenger! It is just like texting only it's free and unlimited. It's great for having a conversation anytime. I think it is the best improvement FB has done in quite awhile.
1,Contrary to all of the bad press this app has gotten, I find it easy to use and tend to use it more than texting. I've even used it to talk with my daughter who is in The Gambia (west Africa).
1,Thanks for your review of Samsung Galaxy S III, White 16GB (Sprint) We're currently processing your review and we will email you at boricua2013jaquez@gmail.com as soon as this is complete.
0,Wow. Ive seen some bad apps before... This is the worst. I cant even USE the app. It always has me force close it. But really.. This made me upset. I would give this app zero stars if I could.
0,I Preferred the old way All of FB messages and games on the same Facebook Page. Now When I'm on Facebook and a message pops up I have to go to messenger page to read and reply to my messages.
1,As a very busy women is much easier to use messenger than try to hunt through all the named on Facebook and find the one I need to message. I use this app daily and would be list without it.
1,This is a great app to use... I use it EVERY DAY! I'm on the computer all day for the most part so sending a message is great because it can be received by anyone with a phone, a tablet, etc.
0,3 stars for the amount of stuff it needs access to. The chat heads do not work. It is quick and easy. I can do without the Facebook Full app to use this. Low profile on battery use.
1,You guys shouldn't take it on Facebook,Amazon or any company
1,my everywhere , even overseas where I spend alot of my time.
1,It's for kindle fire finally????????????????

0,i would've rated it 5 but the app's not updated for kindle fire. :( that's why it keeps crashing every time someone sends me gif. so disappointed.
0,I use a kindle fire and I cant use it. it would be faster if I could use it. I dislike it I wish I could.use it on the kindle fire thanks facebook
0,If youre going to update facebook and make it to where I have to use messenger you couldve at least made sure the nessenger app worked for fire ?
0,It sometimes slows my phone and tablet down especially if more than one person is talking to me at a time, but other than that it is pretty handy.
0,I hate this app. It messes with my messages and notifications on my Fire phone and I wish Facebook had never split off messenger into another app.
1,This is my first experience ever using Facebook. I really like the messenger part of it. I have a lot to learn but I am having a good time with it
1,for some reason, unexplained, FB msgr logs off and I have to remove it totally and redownload. I blamed Hangouts or Chatheads, but I am not sure.
1,I use the messenger a LOT. I have a group with my daughters so we always know what is going on. Easy to use, great stickers, I absolutely love it!
1,I think u should make it compatible with kindle fire and add some upgrades to it.I like it because its very easy and a very fun way to communicate
1,It is wonderful for keeping in touch with frends and family

0,The current version of this app takes forever to connect and has so many bugs.. I've used this for android and had a much better experience. Hopefully they work out the bugs soon...
1,Great addition to my Facebook account
0,Just one more way to waste your time.
1,Facebook deserves five or more stars.
1,Could make it easier to find friends.

0,Doesn't work with Amazon Fire Phone
1,This works perfect with my Fire HD!
1,I am new to it but am happy so far.
1,i olve everything I get from amazon
1,I've used messenger for a while now. I like the convenience since it's available on my kindle.
1,Its really easy to send messages, but you have to have a strong wifi signal to make phone calls.
1,This is excellent when reading on kindle. An icon pops up to let you know that you have messages
1,nice way to keep in touch. what i don't like is the message stays on the screen for a long time.
1,It is fantastic for my smartphone but does not work with my Kindle. I have the original Kindle.
0,It keeps running in the background, very intrusive app. Tried for couple days, now uninstalled.
1,Retained it on smartphone (but not on tablet--too many alerts on tablet). Performance was good.
1,I went to the app store when I click on messenger and I click download and it starts downloading
0,Please upgrade it's not working it's keep telling me to upgrade
0,It doesn't work as fast as it used to. Also, it goes a a couple weeks without working at times.
0,It bogged down my tablet so bad.I deleted it as most everyone else I know has done. Terrible product. Do not waste your time.
0,Well, I can't use it on my kindle. My antivirus software says it has a trojan just like when I tried to download the fb app.
0,I am so disappointed with this app. I can't call, video chat. Let alone i cannot hear anyone. Why have it if it doesn't work?
0,You have no choice for mobile messages, and agree to be spammed. I can't give it less than one star, as it deserves way less.
1,i think it gives us a chance to talk to are friend and have contact hi how are you hi what up what are you doing hey job dude
0,Its ok I just don't like the way the little chat head pops up and gets in the way of whatever els you're doing at the moment.
1,Essentially free texting with your friends who also use the app. Saves on minutes for those of us that use pre-paid phones.
0,I live in a different state than my family does and I love to video chat them on FB but it doesn't work on the Amazon tablet
0,It's OK if you like to use that type of venue. I don't type without staring at the keyboard. Thus I do not use FB Messenger.
0,I don't like having the picture on my screen for anybody to see who is sending me messages. I prefer it to be more private.
1,Works great!!
0,Not necessary
1,Very helpful.
0,I get a fail.
0,Not necessary

1,great to have
1,Love it......

1,Awesome!!!!!!
0,Terrible. right after installation then it worked. Later, it was forced closed every time opening. Useless.
0,Why is the regular Facebook app down from the Fire store and why don't videos work on Facebook for Fire Phone?
0,Would be a great app if it didn't drain the battery. Installed it twice with the same results. Terrible app.
1,This app works really great! I especially like this app since I use my Kindle or BlackBerry most of the time.
1,Work's greatest for message s call's and even video call's. I have no bad things to say. And that Say's a lot!
1,Iit is part of my daily quality times with friends and family.we use it forbour link to healthcare for my dad.
0,I think it's a good app to contact or talk to people around the world but for the calling it need to improve?
0,It sucks takes up GB on my phone I hate using when I could use them for more important things !! I HATTEEE IT

1,Love Facebook messenger
1,Foes what it should do.
1,Fast & like the emojies
1,Works most of the time.
0,Not compatible with Fire .... as usual.
0,Too politically correctness. Has a large tendency in not allowing one their right of free speech. If it weren't for my son serving in Afghanistan and this was the way to talk to him I would never have gotten an account with this program
0,This app is complete junk on kindle fire hd! Do not waste your time downloading it! Takes forever for it to connect to network then when it does finally connect it last for 1-2seconds not counting the only way to get rid of the little bubble thing that pops up is you have to turn the kindle long ways every time.... Sent a complaint to developer 3 days ago about the network issue and still no reply so I uninstalled it. JUNK ALERT JUNK ALERT JUNK ALERT!!!!!!
1,This is a good app to chat with your friends and to everyone who said this DIDN'T work on kindle fire, are you referring to the fact you can't call? Because that is not how kindles work. There is no microphone unless you connect one, so you cannot call unless you have a microphone or have this on your phone. But anyway, fantastic app, fun stickers, emojis, all that fun stuff. 5 out of 5!
0,Well when I first got my Fire Phone it worked just fine. Ever since google did their update, yes I know google and Facebook are different, but since then Facebook messenger hangs on log in so I'm stuck with the loading circle and it never loads up my messages or contacts. Please fix this a.s.a.p. I'm just glad I can at least still messenger through the normal Facebook app but that doesn't allow you to make calls over messenger. I'd really like to have that feature back. It's perfect for when you know someone but don't have their cell number but you're friends on Facebook
1,Love that you can talk on this. Daughter and family stationed out of country. Many times all lines are busy... Yet, we can still talk on messenger! Thank God! I need that. Miss them and their internet isn't always full strength for Skype.
1,I submitted a review Yesterday, to your staff, Sirs. Perhaps it didn't meet your needs. Then, it may have been misplaced. In any case, another should be tendered quite soon. We shall do so...after all,Sirs, your. FACEBOOK MESSENGER Service is really Not only speedy...it draws quick response ! VERY . Nice, actually. Thank you. ea
0,I do not like being forced into this messenger app. I use Facebook on my phone and my laptop as does most of the world and, the only way you area allowed to view messages on a mobile device is with this app. It functions well, but I feel it is unnecessary.
0,This app works with my kindle fire HDX but when I click on emojis icon or to share pic I get nothin whatsoever. All u can do is chat here and I'm.pretty sure we've been telling you that for at least a year or two since I've had my kindle fire HDX. Is there anyone actually reading and troubleshooting your reviews or do you just provide them as a chance for us to vent. Waaaaaay poor customer service on your part. In addition I have multiple bugs affecting my regular facebook app and when I try to review it I'm told only people who have made at least one Amazon purchase are allowed to leave reviews??? Not including free digital downloads, it says??? Well, you might want to check your records and you'll see that I have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon instant video, Amazon smile, Amazon everything, so I dont expect to restricted from anything on your site, thanks.
0,Hate all msgrs. Useless when MSN, Hotmail , rr, ameritech, Google, yahoo tried them and failed.. Why does anyone want to be Available 24/7 to anyone is beside me. I am computer field and feel Msgr for any site is a huge annoyance????
1,Great free, Clean download from a trusted source.
1,I really enjoy this option on Facebook it is fast
1,Other apps works great. Haven't used this on much
1,Simple, easy, fast way to stay in touch privately
1,This makes things so much easier to stay in touch
1,Haven't used it much yet, but seems to work well.
1,Good way to talk with others that have messenger.
1,I had not used this until this week....very nice.
0,Deactivated my facebook account. Too many people.
0,It doesn't work on my Amazon kindle fire really?
1,Perfect! I use this every day for chat whit my girlfriend.
1,Saves me the trouble of running the annoying Facebook app.
0,I like nothing about it nor does anyone I have talked with
0,don't like it. it doesn't seem to work on my kindle at all
1,Works on my smart phone, and does what it says it will do.
1,It works perfectly for my kindle fire &#60;3 I love it

1,It's great.
1,Easy to use
1,Fun to use.
1,Easy to use
1,Now working on kindle fire.....just got mine and I am totally addicted to this app...awesome!
1,It works as it should, but I preferred the messenger service that used to come with Facebook.
0,It's inconvenient...I have to click on messenger then go back to fb..to pick up my messages..
1,Since I live on Facebook I can basically play games on full screen and not miss messages..yay
1,Love it, great way to keep in touch with friends & family even when I can't be at my computer
1,finally i can check messages on my tablet only draw back had to try several time to download
0,I deleted it because its to evasive..I dont think they need access to everything on my phone.
1,I love this app it's faster like when UR playing a game u don't have to click out if the game
0,I do not like being forced by social media to sign up for something that dominates my device.
0,Hate the new messenger. When your update an app it should be better but with this you failed.
0,I hate that I now have to have an app to use the FB messenger feature on my phone. I have installed it a few times due to necessity but always uninstall as soon as possible because the app tries to override the other message (text) app I already have and it shows up the little picture icon to message anyone at any time when I use a variety of other apps, including when I am trying to read a book via Kindle. It is highly annoying. I don't care for it at all.
0,The regular Facebook app has this functionality. As annoying as that application is, it does open and sort of work. Crashes without ever starting post-update. More lazy, shabby support for the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9
0,I downloaded this app and it worked okay for about 30 seconds and then it froze and I was unable to send or receive messages at all, I was also unable to use the Facebook app messenger or the Facebook app itself to look at my wall. As soon as I uninstall this application everything went back to working just fine. I do not recommend this app for kindle fire users.
1,Notifications don't really work for the Fire Phone, but everything else seems alright.
1,I down loaded this even though a lot said it did not work with kindle. Perhaps they did some up dates but this app works fine and I can even use the phone and make quality calls and talk with this app. I see no problems with it if your looking for away to connect with friends and family via text or phone then this works great.
1,Everything about this messaging app is great. The design is a blatant iOS rip off but it looks good and I like how it shows who's active, when they're active, when they've read your message, and when they're typing. I wish I could use this as my default messaging app. And it works on my Kindle which is great!
1,Everyone thinks FB is like the NSA, which it may be, but this app is awesome. You can text and call (video or not) via data. It's like What's App and Skype combined except that more people have this so you don't have to invite them to What's App or find out if they have a Skype account. Also, like iMessage, you can see that someone is responding to your text so you know to wait until they finish to text again. I was overseas with this app (free data) and could call my wife on her cell phone via this. Yes, you could do the same thing via Skype (pay to her cell number) but to do it for free she has to be logged into Skype. I think this thing is great.
1,Its faster then texting I love this application its what I use for all my messaging love the call features makes staying in touch with loved ones so much easier
1,This app enables me to keep in touch with all of my family and friends from abraod. It is easy to use and notifies me when I have messages. I don't know what I would do without this app! I don't have to go into Facebook to use this app which is nice. I can just open messenger and beging talking to someone.
1,This app works just fine for me. I'm a mom to lots of kiddos and we are a busy family. This gives me freedom to talk with my kids and relatives no matter where I am or what device I am on.
1,I like it.
1,Works well

1,Why are you guys complaining?! This app is GREAT , it gives me the chat head even if I'm in another app or on the web! I love this & I'm glad I can get it on my kindle fire hd (: ! Amazing app !!!
1,I mainly use Facebook for the Chat, and nothing else. This is basically meant for me. And when I use it I can use just about any app and this one at the same time. Just tap the circle of the person I'm talking to and it brings up an overlay. Type, send and tap it again to shrink it back to a circle! No more leaving my web browsing to answer a message!
0,THE ONLY THING I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT IT, IS THAT IT IS GOVERNMENT OWNED FACEBOOK PERIOD IS. THIS HAS SO MUCH LOW-JACK ON IT. JUST MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, OR YOU ARE A HACKER, AND CAN REMOVE CERTAIN FILES. I PERSONALLY PREFER A ROOTED PHONE. YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH A ROOTED PHONE. BOTH FACEBOOK APP, AND FB MESSENGER APP, THEY CAN LISTEN TO PHONE CALLS, READ YOUR TEXTS, LOOK AT YOUR CAM, LISTEN TO YOU ANYTIME THEY WANT SAME WITH THE CAM. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT BOUGHT IT OUT. YOU CAN THINK THAT I AM A CONSPIRACY NUT, BUT GOD HAS BLESSED ME WITH COMPUTER SKILLS, MOST OF YOU WILL PROBABLY GO TO SNOPES.COM, BUT THAT IS ALSO GOVERNMENT OWNED. THIS WAS ON THE NEWS ALSO JUST SO YOU KNOW. LOOK IT UP ON YOUTUBE.
1,I had resisted getting Messenger for a long time, thought I had no need for it. Now I don't know how I lived without it! So many things to love. separate from the fb app, you can still surf the net or troll fb and your little chat bubble will notify you when you have a message. Stickers are easy to get to, and last night I tried video chat with my daughter in college. We had a great time. Video was a bit choppy at times but audio never wavered. I put this on my kindle hd 6 and have not had any problems.
1,Messenger is fantastic. It links your Facebook friends separately from your Facebook page so you can txt free instead of using your txt minutes from your phone. If You have Wi-Fi it doesn't use your data either. Pretty nifty I think. Unlike my phone messaging not responding most of the time, messenger works most of the time.
0,It has been working for me on my Kindle Fire HDX good, with one exception. Sometimes when I click on the chat heads, they dissapear, and I have to go back to messenger, taking the reason I got the app out. And yes, I did check the chat heads can poo up through other apps that take up the whole screen.
0,All my past chats and conversations disappear on their own. This happens to me on Android and BlackBerry devices as well. You need an update on Facebook Messenger for Kindle, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry A.S.A.P.!!!!!
0,I hate it. Facebook should've never done this to us. It's ALWAYS ON. I don't know how to deactivate it. Everytime somebody sends me a facebook message it goes directly to messenger and all my wireless devices ding. How can I be running messenger on 3 different devices plus my laptop at the same time?? I use this app only because it's apparently the only way to get my facebook messages on a mobile device but I'm seriously considering removing it from all the devices and just making it not be an emergency because i'd really like to NOT have this thing bothering me all day and night. I at least know how to silence text messaging. EDIT to add: The thing that really bugs me about this is that it does not allow me access to my "other" inbox on facebook. I belong to a number of groups on facebook where I communicate with other members there but we are not facebook "friends". When we message one another about something better handled over private message than publicly in the group, it seems to be about a 50-50 chance whether it will go to my real inbox or my "other" inbox. Sometimes it takes days of me not seeing a message before the person says I need to check my "other" inbox and then I have to go log on to my pc if I want to read the message because this app doesn't have any way for me to check the other inbox.
0,So, before fireos 4.0 I side loaded fbm from that other play store and it worked fine but it was slllooooooow. So much so that I uninstalled it. The app was never made available in the Amazon app store. But now that I have the fireos 4.0 upgrade, I went into the Appstore and it was sitting there waiting to be installed. I did and it runs a lot smoother. I am no huge fan of fbm. But I do use it, and having it available on all my devices finally is nice. I, personally, think all the security clearance concerns with it are overblown. Facebook itself is one big privacy ignoring entity. If you use Facebook, and fbm, then you have to use this app, like it or not.
1,love this i get to talk all i want to my friends..

1,Very useful and clever to use. I use it constantly on my mobile and I am able to keep up with my friends on facebook who also have tablets and mobile phones. Great Job!
0,messenger is no good bcuz the government is going through your conversation and so are other people just delete it is not good unless u want people to look at your stuff.
0,I just got a new kindle fire and was planning on getting this app. But it doesn't work. Will it be fixed soon or am I gonna be forced to wait twenty decades for it?!?!?!
1,Didn't know this was from amazon. But can't live without it. My daughter lives in an area that can only message by FB, no 4G wouldn't be able to talk to her without it.
1,I don't know why everyone is saying it doesn't work for the kindle fire...downloaded it, and it's working just fine...just need Instagram to be kindle fire compatible...
1,Very quick and easy access to check messages without visiting my page makes this a great asset to have. Plus it's features and functions shouldn't be frowned upon either
0,I tried to reinstall it because it wasn't working. Now I am trying to install it a d its not working. I know it isn't my device because every other app works perfectly!
1,I've yet to have any issue with this application. I am a straight tablet user and I'll say it works great! Fast,easy,no glitches to my reckoning. I give it a thumbs up!
1,I keep getting a pop up message that tells me to update to the new messenger so I click it and it takes me to the app yet there is no update button to click on ???? Lol
1,its totally compatible with my kindle. i love how i can still be on other apps and use it. and the update is awesome, i love how u can give your friends nicknames also.
1,This app is great! I talk to my friends on it most of the day! It tells u when people are available to talk to and if they have read your text, GREAT APP!!! Get it !!! But it has to be linked with Facebook.
0,this s*** is annoying I can I have to wake up to someone else text if they're not messaging me you know family messages is just crazy like I just want my messages not everybody else and the fact that the notification don't work so I can turn this s*** off so I had to uninstall it disappointed
0,It's sometimes with texting but it has most of the problems with calling. I try to call my mother and every 2 seconds something was wrong with it, same with texting,I click the button to send my text and it says messenger has stopped every time. it goes to show not every thing works 24/7
0,This app is great, but DON'T DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE. For KFHD, the app will instantly crash, and close if you try to open it after the update.
0,OMG, use it once and it stays active and drains my battery like crazy >.< Have to keep force stopping the damn thing. I hate this app with a passion, but its the only one I can use on Kindle. >.< I love my fires, but damn if Amazon screws me by not letting me use Google, so I was forced to buy an Android tablet to be able to use out and about and leave my Fire at home to only use at home. ;(
1,I got this app for my kindle fire hd but it was not compatible, but with the fire phone I got for my son today. It's the same as the facebook app but easier for phones.
1,This app is great. Love it. However, I went from the android version to this one and it feels outdated. The features are like the old style. It's been upgraded a lot... why not upgrade it here? Fix pleade?
0,Messenger sucks! It never works... it slows down your phone, install every time you get a message uninstall because it messes up your phone Now I have messages and it wont install Its rediculious maddening and completely uncalled for!
1,I think the Facebook messenger is great. It gives you the option of text, calling or Skype messaging. Easy access and it's quick.
1,THIS APP IS SO AMAZING! It work really good I have no problems with it love it. Some people say it don't work but for me it does
1,Works great on my new slimline Kindlefire. Also works on my 6&#34; Kindlefire, I have no complaints at all
1,we are to download. apps. and games. I also think tablets are to have fun. we are free on the tablet.
1,Couldn't live without it! Keeps me in touch with friends and family and helps to manage a busy life... Fun too!
1,Good app. I have it in my phone, but I wanted to download it to my Kindle and it works great! I'm glad I did :D
0,Not very good when u let scam artists hack in to precious Facebook. Quit sitting on your hands and do your job.
0,I just hate that I need to download this app onto my phone to IM. More apps less room on my phone boo facebook
1,Love the instant connection between friends and not having to get into Facebook and scroll through everything.
1,great way to stay in contact with my relatives from other states. especially when we can not talk on the phone
0,Sometimes lets you know your message has been seen and others times there is no confirmation. Not consistent.
1,It works as smoothly on my phone except I had to wait a few seconds longer for it to go from black to the app.
1,Makes it really easy to communicate with Facebook friends directly!
1,Like it because when I am doing other things, I can check messages.
1,This DOES work with with KINDLE fire I use it all the time!!!!!!!!
1,I liked this app. It could use some improvements but overall great!
1,I like being able to easily contact people I know who are far away.
1,Really like, just learning my way around tablet...this was helpful.
1,Nice and convenient app. Keeps me in touch with friends and family.
1,Works great and I love the record feature so I don't have to text !
1,is and great app .. easy way to stay conect with family and friends
1,It worked great on my Kindle for the few weeks I had a Kindle fire.
1,I did not know I had it in till my Daughter put me on it.I can see her just like she's right here.
0,I really don't like that it invades the Kindle, whether or not I wish to be messaging in Facebook.
1,Amazing job. Thanks so much Amazon, you have the best site out there.So proud to be a part of it.
1,It works great. Chat heads open. The app dosen't close on you. It works like it would on an iPhone
1,Very pleased
0,Just not me.
1,Easy to use.
0,I don't like it at all. I don't like how I may have it in active I still get pop ups on my phone.
0,Did not properly download. Twice. What gives?Uninstalled the app and have not tried a third time.
0,I like the other way I got my messages, in the little box that was by your friend requests icon..
1,I've seen pretty had reviews and made me very reluctant to download. I went ahead anyways, works perfectly fine ?
0,Liked my old messaging system better. It was easier to use. People's profile pictures pop up and don't go away!
1,have used FB Messenger for a number of years. really like it, it's an easier way to have a private conversation.
1,The Facebook Messenger is a great way to know I have a message in my inbox. Awesome, I love it. Thank you Amazon.
1,I am so happy to have joined the facebook group - it keeps me posted on what is going on with family and friends.
1,This app is great! It works with my fire, and I can use it in Netflix without having to leave the app!! So happy!
1,It might not work on kindle fire hd but it makes it a lot easier to use Facebook when I'm working on other things
0,Seems to have an issue keeping me connected and logged in, but when it works, it works just like the android app.
0,Kindle Fire has it's pros, it also has it's cons. Not compatible with Facebook Messenger, or Criminal Case on FB.
0,Not a facebook fan in general, was more aggravated that I had to download an app just to use personal messaging.
0,Meh... it's Facebook Messenger. I guess the thing I like the most about messenger is the variety of stickers you can insert into your conversations. Works well, serves it's purpose.
1,I have just signed up a few days ago but I have found it to be a faster and more convenient way of keeping in touch. It will also save money for me since I do have to pay for texts.
0,I don't think people should be forced into a program that allows others access to your personal information. I don't mind the chat messenger itself but I hate the politics around it.
0,failure to work on one of the most popular android devices that exists is a massively poor business decision. I would think creating a fire version wouldn't be that hard a port.
1,I have great things to say about messenger. I can always get thru, always have a great time talking to and seeing my grand and great Grand children on facetime, don't change a thing
1,I think it is crucial to be able to log off Facebook messenger from any device, especially if we have children, we share devices with. It can't be that difficult to add this option.
0,Facebook messenger was working on my kindle fire, But for some really strange reason it's not working anymore. I tried to delete it so I could redownload it yet again it didn't work
0,I would prefer it go back so that I could go back to using it on my computer and not be requried sign into the Facebook page to use it. I was very disappointed when it was changed.
1,Love it! I am able to visit with my children. It opens up a whole new world for me. The Facebook Messenger aides me to also get my meetings from the Kingdom Hall when I can't go.
0,The time goes to quickly to find all the hidden objects without having to use some of the tools, but to use tools you have to buy stamps. It is fun, but much too expensive for me.

0,Its alright. When Calling people on the kindle, you can't hear or talk to people. I hope they fix that.
1,Enjoy keeping up with family and friends on Facebook Some of the language could be better or much nicer
0,ThiS app needs to be secured. It's not a secure application and presents virus scan alet's constantly.
1,Love the messenger app. The chat heads make it easier to manage multiple conversations at the same time
1,it is nice to have it you can call and messenger your friends and family members I love it you can too
1,I don't know what you guys are talking about. this app would be perfect if it let you make phone calls.
0,Doesn't work with Kindle Fire. All FB apps I've tried don't function normally with Kindle. No stars...

0,Wasn't the app
1,It's working on my phone, but it's been trying to update for three days. Keeps sending an error with the installation. The app continues to work, but this update continues to fail.
0,Freezes up quite frequently and even when I didn't have a new message, every time I was on the phone talking to somebody, a picture from someone on facebook, at random, popped up.
1,I love Amazon. com.I can find anything easy too. great products and delivery services. love face book messenger also. great way to keep up with everything. friends, family.rate 5.
1,I use it quite often. If someone is online and I have a question or comment for them specifically, I will message them. Usually they will reply immediately. Pretty cool, I think.
1,Facebook Messenger is everything that it claims. Excellent for instant communication with family and friends. I recommend this app to anyone who enjoys communicating instantly.
0,I honestly use this app more than the SMS app on my phone. The only problem is that it worked for a good week on my new Fire tablet, but now it crashes any time I try to open it.
0,Video is good but echoes, voice delays, low volume makes it annoying. Good though if you haven't seen someone in long time cause they're out of state wanna be part of the moment
1,I like messanger for several reasons but one at the top of the reasons is if they are a Facebook friend I don't need a phone number or anything to contact them and it is private!
0,Didn't care for it.as soon as I got it on the kindle it just drained my battery.I went from 100% battery to about 15% battery life in a matter of 10 minutes so I just deleted it.
1,Surprisingly works well on a Kindle. Now I can chat when a message comes up vs needing to use the messenger app on my phone or going to my desktop. Keeps me in touch with people.
0,I don't like it

0,Every time I try to download this app on my fire phone it will install, and when I go to click on the app, it's just a blank white or black screen.. Called &#34;Mayday&#34; about it and they could not fix my problem out of the 5 times I had called.
1,this is the most awesome and kinda funny at the same time app in thwle hole world and it works in kindle fire so dont get mad just because people say that it doesnt work but go ahead and download it i hope this was helpful to who ever is readi g thank u and bye bye
0,Did not order this app. I do not do Facebook. Somehow Amazon digital order system sells things without final authorization. This is the 2nd unauthorized digital "purchase" on my account. Amazon please enhance your order control procedures.
1,I recently viewed 1 free month of Amazon Prime, I enjoyed the program choices but when it comes time to join you only show price per year, I'm retired and on a fixed income so monthly payments who be the only way I could afford to join. If at some time you start a monthly payment program please let me know as I would be interested in joining. Steve K. w8etd@yahoo.com
0,To too complicated to use if you don't use Faceboook that much. If you're not a social butterfly I would prefer just using regular text. Even when I logged off Facebook it showed me still active on messenger. Only way to stop it wasdeleting the app. if you like everyone knowing what you're doing this is the app for you.
1,Great App!
0,it worked brilliantly then sound on video calling stopped 2 days ago. downloaded latest vers now trhe blank screen & nothing! as the previous lady described........ well that was the vers from playstore. just downloaded from here, had to restart kindle - but touch wood its fully working! :)
1,Fun and easy to use. I really like that you can appear online for certain people and offline for the rest. I love that my daughter can send me clips of her a cappella group during practice and links of puppies and kittens to brighten my day.
1,I don't know what issues other people are having, but I downloaded FB Messenger in early January 2015 and was speaking with a my GF on a cruise ship in SE Asia within 1 1/2 minutes. It worked in exactly the same way as it does on my iPhone, except the internet connection on the ship was very weak, and she heard some annoying echo at her end. I did not try using a headphone with microphone yet. This would probably have solved the echo problem.
0,Tried to install update.all I received was failed to install over and over like a never ending loop.just another facebook failure of good customer service.free should not mean defective.now it won't allow me to submit this bad review.
1,Facebook Messenger?This messaging app works great with my Android phone to communicate with Facebook friends :)
1,I grew up with a rotary phone & black/ white tv . And wasn't sure about of this new technology . But now I would be lost without it.
1,This is SUPER helpful with kindle fire!!! So easy to be on app and not having to leave the app to be on messenger!!! SUPER smart!!!!
0,Facebook messenger is terrible u can only text people and not call just use the normal facebook app it's better fix the app facebook
1,I recently downloaded the app on my kindle and it has worked great from day one. I use it every day. Thanks for making a quality app
0,Why do u have to have facebook? It's a good app my mom has it I don't have a face book I'm only 10 I want to talk to my friends too!
0,just garbage. make an app that works. back up what you do. just thrown together and forgotten. might as well throw your kindle away.
1,I sure have enjoyed receiving and talking to people that I need to, with out everyone knowing what I say to the other person.
1,I like Facebook messenger. It's easy to use and I can keep in touch with close family and friends without having to go to the site.
0,the annoying circle doesn't go away on my phone and sits in the middle of whatever I am working on. If I am in facebook it is ok.
0,My facebook app and messenger is not working unless I'm connected to my wifi at home.
0,not as quick or easy to use as the facebook messenger app on iOS but still a good app
1,My husband has the only phone so this is how we reach each other through out the day.
1,The game is pretty interesting. My only issue is that u can't go to different levels.
1,It works real good for me the printing is large and I can see it better than my phone
0,How do I sign out? There is no button to sign out. Other than that, the app is okay
1,My Kindle Fire runs messenger perfectly! Sucks that others are having issues with it.
1,I use this app everyday... I've never had any problems out of it like some people do.
1,I really enjoy this messenger more than I thought I would. No issues with it so far.
1,I like messenger because it is easy to messenge my friends and those in my contacts.

1,Overall it's good. But I cannot choose emojis when I need to use them. The icon is just there when I click on it, it doesn't work.
1,noting is wrong with it there was one time where is was not working on my kindle fire but that wwas just kindle the thing is old.
1,This is a full-featured product, beyond anything I've ever used. If you've got time to kill, Facebook Messenger will optimize it.
0,I does connect to Facebook, which is its main purpose, but it crashes from time to time and is generally slow. It is what it is.
0,A bit confusing to use. ( I'm old people) and does not allow me to contact people on my Facebook despite their having messenger ?
0,I use messenger daily and all of the sudden I can play videos that were sent to me!!! I can view it on my phone but not my kindle
0,Why offer it if it's useless to the Kindle Fire user? It doesn't even deserve a star, if I could give it a negative star I would.
0,I recently had an update automatically placed on my phone. The new Facebook app is cool but keeps crashing. Please fix this issue
1,Like having all of the extra space to send messages. Just realized that the indicator for a message appears on Facebook as well.
1,It's a great app. Messages appear instantly so it's convenient.
0,Crashes on startup, doesnt work with newest Fire Phone update.
1,I use this app a lot to talk to friends and family in the us.
1,So far I like it. Can talk with my grandchildren when I want.

1,easy to use
1,Convenient.
1,I saw the reviews, but since they had not been updated for a few months, I went ahead and got the app. Does all the same things my iPhone messenger did. No problem.
0,This app sucks on the Amazon store. Gifs didn't work, it's not the same version as droid so we're always outdated. Not pleased. Side loading the droid version. Ugh
0,It doesn't work,after you installed it ask for an update but it can't be updated,and when you try to open it the device return to home.You really need to fix this.
0,I keep getting prompts for an update. I keep getting notifications to update. Update keeps failing. Fix this, or don't offer auto update on this system. Seriously.
1,It now does work with Kindle Fire!! It has for awhile and the reviews saying it doesn't aren't up-to-date! Amazon users can use the app just like Apple or Android!
1,Best app ever. I wish regular text messaging had that collapsible window that opens over whatever you are already doing. I hate having to stop to answer a message.
1,Messenger works the best on kindle fire I don't know why people complain about it not working maybe You should get a Facebook first and then use it duh??????
1,Before you couldn't use the kindle now it's the best thing to use messenger on... it gives you the bubble chat so you can use apps and message people well worth it
0,Some people get a little more security having their phone.I am getting ready to close down my Facebook b/c I feel it is too incredibly invasive on my personal lifr
0,I haven't really used it very much from the time I have used it I like it real well but like I said I haven't used it very much since I got it but I probably will

1,I enjoy talking with video but we are always having problem with the sound. Last conversation between USA-Germany was really bad that I could not understand 90% of what my friend was talking about :( The video wasn't great but manageable...
0,Need to update app to include updated Messenger functions like seeing and setting the different themes, etc.
0,I have a lot of problems with the audio-when I can hear it it breaks up so I only hear 1/2 the sentence. Also, the video and audio don't match. It's like watching a Japanese movie that has been dubbed in English. I'm using a 3rd generation Amazon Fire so this may be part of the problem, I don't know.
1,It's the same android application. It woks correctly. It has one bug with the amazon os interaction. The conversation bubbles get stuck in some middle ui layer: they don't show in the os UI, but when the screen changes, you can see them in limbo and you can actually drag them to the native android's close bubble in the center of the bottom edge. WEIRD. Facebook didn't port it correctly. It's like they didn't use the right api or something.
1,Good to have messenger on my Kindle tablet. I had no problems getting to use it. Now besides my smartphone, I enjoy having my friends on a bigger screen , like my Kindle Fire 8. I love the size of the screen it's bigger than my smartphone screen. Looks great.
0,Works like crap!! Sometimes I go days without a notification only to find in my email that I have missed a bunch of messages. It seems to time out and then you have to log in. I liked the old FB chat way better.
1,My son is on a European trip with his senior class. This is the only thing that would get through to him. Apparently there are not a lot of cell towers over there and I was able to communicate with him and make sure he was OK.
0,I didn't like that crashed in Kindle fire hd8.9.Wasn't able to use it.The call froze too.It works for other devices just fine.But the kindle installation crashed.Their needs to be a fix for every tablet.
0,Works just fine for me! Some things are still buggy, but for the most part everything works just fine! Please fix the notifications, I can't hear them. And I can't use stickers, add photos or use emojis
0,It was short lived for the time I used it. I installed it because facebook kept whining at me to do so, and I was tired of the notification I get from people inviting me to messenger. Once I installed it, it constantly made notifications, and I couldn't even disable them. Along with that, I could not find an option to log off. Googled it and everything just said to uninstall it if you're using Android; so I did. I'm guessing this works better on better devices, but for Android, I strongly recommend not getting this.
1,Very confident and portable alternative to text messaging. Too bad they feed all of your communications to the CIA, DIA, and whatever other three letter agency wants it.......
1,Surprisingly good application which allowed smooth video over IP between Michigan and Greece. If you have to deal with f/b, this is a useful addition. I kind of like the ding
1,I personally believe that this app,is important and amazing also for Many reasons like checking text faster and in more quality P.S.a little better than,Facebook texting.
1,Seems to work fine for mine. I had read the reviews that said it didn't work before and it deterred me from downloading it. Downloaded it earlier and it seems to work just fine
1,I like this application, but it is so new that it still needs some tweeking. It's confusing to novices. The difference between messenger and messaging is sometimes frustrating.
0,Works great on my kFHD6 installed the update and now it won't even open the app what a let down......... and now I have to shut my security off to re install the app wth!!!!!!
1,Simple to use. I live up north (in Sedona, az) and my cell reception is almost non-existent so this app let's me keep in touch via messaging over WiFi. I'd be lost without it.
1,Read some reviews saying that this Facebook best you didn't work well or then work on a Kindle. it works fine! Colorful, responsive, witha great message notification feature.
1,Nice upgrade from the old messenger system that Facebook used to have. Seems to be much more of a full-featured messenger app with better options for photos and emoticons
1,I am so glad that I finally got this app. When you have a quick question or remark to make to someone it is so much easier and less time consuming than a phone call or email.
1,Great

0,Zero stars! Won't work on my fire now! Did! Now doesn't! BULL.SHIT.
0,Really?!?! How does this not work with the kindle this makes me mad
0,December 2015 messenger not working on kindle fire 7 5th generation
0,All it did was crash - every time I tried to use it on my Kindle HD
1,Fast, know when party is writing a response plus other capabilities
1,I don't really know how to use it yet,trying to get used to it!!!!!
0,I don't really need to know about every time someone posts anything
0,The app didn't load properly and wouldn't open so I uninstalled it.
1,I have kindle fire he and it works perfectly..my husband have the fire phone and that whAt he use.. Facebook messenger does work on both kindle fire hd and fire phone..miss guided information that it don't work..stop it
0,Its worked great until it didn't. Just did an update and the update keeps failing and messenger won't work because of it
1,you know what say bet I totally I like it show mean that "facebook messenger " as wonderful. or bravo sometime do I. don't have a seen yet coming download near our kindle fire my stuff on tablet . I not sure a least pay it in amazon somewhere by belong...
1,This is a good app and it is compatible with my Kindle Fire HD. I love it and it's amazing.....but it will not update. I have tried to delete thing to see if it's just storage but it's not. I give it 4 stars
1,Idk if it's just that now they have one, but most of the reviews were about how it didn't work for kindle. Yet when I opened it, it was blank for a little while then it pulled it up. I signed in and it works perfectly for me.
1,App works okay on Fire Phone. I have trouble with it not opening from Facebook and it opens during calls.
1,All it is is the Facebook chat but you can send videos and recordings. There are also more stickers
0,When using Messenger a few weeks ago, suddenly my keyboard didn't respond to touch, only taps, and the word autocorrect needed multiple hard taps. Amazon tech support talked me through resetting it. I hadn't connected it to Messenger at that point. Yesterday it happened again, only worse, and despite their best efforts, the tech team couldn't get it working. I had to do a complete reset to factory settings. Fortunately I had most things backed up but still spent HOURS restoring apps and data. This happened again while using Messenger. So do NOT install it on your kindle fire. If it's on, uninstall it. Don't think because it's working fine now, that it's okay. I didn't have an immediate problem. It took weeks until it happened to me and I'm positive it was Messenger that messed it up because at first the problem only occurred with that app, THEN it spread to everything. Next, I'm sending a complaint to FB in the hope that they will fix it.
1,I have this app on my Kindle Fire and it is awesome. It lets me chat with friends from facebook.
0,It is a nuisance since it is now separate from the Facebook page itself. I don't know how accurate the information is about lack of privacy. I just don't understand the purpose of making it a separate ap
0,The version you have here is late already and there isstill no update to version 23? Please release update.
1,Superb app to supplement Facebook. VERY convenient and easy to use. Add photos and emoticons with a snap!
1,works my kindle fire very smoothly good good love the chat head weird that it dont work for other people...

1,It works great to message you family and friends stay in touch with cousins that live far away. Thank you
0,Won't install. I even deleted some apps to try to get this thing to install, but it obviously didn't work.
0,My phone and computer has been trying to upgrade fb since I downloaded it which makes it impossible to use
0,It's just like a text. I get way more texts then I want. It's like having 2 phones constantly going off.
1,Excellent way of communicating with friends.

1,It seems to be a good app but I can't seem to find the setting for not showing "chat" heads on display.
1,Great way to keep in touch with friends and family who do everything on their phones. I prefer using my Tablet.
0,Not impressed. Just let me message from Facebook. I already know how to do that. This is not an improvement.
1,Wasn't even VAGUELY interested in using apps...perfectly happy with browsers. Now it's the first thing I check.
1,Wonderful app. It's quite easy to get messages to people bypassing the regular facebook. And it's very private.
0,Worked good then an update now of doesn't work at all. What happened. How did you mess up a messaging app. How?

1,Great app-- works well and is free.
1,Ok I tried getting this in 2013 and now I finally get it you should put all apps from Google play store and Apple store. It's a great app and it works now for my kindle fire HD now
1,Work first time every time. Never any glitches or crashes. Still learning about the things it can do. I like it. My phone co. Charges my .20 per text so I save money by using this.
1,I like how easy it was to set up and was surprised with the phone option...so quick to get through to the relatives and didn't even need to leave the Kindle to pick up a phone.
1,It really works on this kindle fire I am using those other reviews need to be updated or they are too inexperienced with rating applications. This really works how it's supposed to we can do everything it needs to do.
0,I would give this app more stars if Facebook would stop listening to conversations, reading text on any message app, & give us back our privacy!!! Fb also can tell which websites we visit, read our emails, and download friend listing and address book...WHERE DID OUR PRIVACY GO???
0,The app is telling me I have a message to review but when I check there are no new messages. It's been this way the whole time. Everything else still works though.
1,Allows me to stay in contact with friends and family while on the go. It's great not having to open up the Facebook app anymore which can slow my phone down A LOT.
0,It is not notifying me when someone meshes me
1,I love this app on my kindle. It works great. I can have Facebook messenger bubbles, and do everything else without having to get back on Facebook. Some reviews say horrible, but it works just fine.
1,Love it, but I recently got a new Amazon Fire Phone 32 MB unlocked, and it won't load? It will let me sign in but not load. Can someone please help? And yes, everything else works, even my facebook app, but as soon as I try to send a message I'm SOL...
1,What to expect!
1,I like this app

0,It's a nice way to communicate but it can be a bit distracting too...
0,Love the convenience, dislike fact that it uses so much battery life.
1,I love using it so i dont know what you guys be ?aying about it
1,Great way to message friends quickly and more importantly, privately.

1,Awesome way to chat with friends back door
1,This works quite nicely, I enjoy using it.
1,Facebook messenger is great. No problems.
1,Love it... works well on phone and tablet!
0,Works for just conversation but when anyone send my gifs it wont let me in to see or lets me in and immediately closes. This only happens w my kindle fire hdx, no other device.
1,Am new to messenger but like it very much including setup, and cute icons that r available. My favorite is the dog looking creature that shakes his pink heart colored fanny.LoL!
0,I already hated apps. Now they split facebook into two equally pointless apps, with the same amount of functionality and versatility as a bowl of spaghetti-o's. Fuckerburg.
0,I haven't been able to play videos within this app for months. I've complained several times and nothing has been done. How long does it take to fix this very important issue?
0,I got this app in hopes I would be able to see the chat heads so I won't have to open the Facebook app all the time but the chat heads aren't anywhere even you get a new message
1,It worked great!....if you don't have a phone number use a house phone number........if it says something about the code click not now and connect with your friends on Facebook!
1,This really works well. I can contact or be contacted without having to be on Facebook. I can have instant connections with my mother of 93. It's been a blessing for her and me.
0,It cant support call option. It always crashing hence u have to restart again the kindle. So u can have the option of not using the call option if u don't want to restart again.
1,I honestly love this app. It is very cool, and my only issue is that its slow to load up. You press the app swiping button and it freezes up a bit BUT always recovers quickly.
1,I am old and I resist change, but in the end I always succumb. This is new stuff and I find it easy and useful. It is important to make every effort to keep up and be current.
0,I do not like the fact that this is the only way I can access my messages. I feel that there should be other options.
1,I LOVE The Communication.
1,Good to get for everyone.
1,Ease of download and use.
1,Love this convenient app.
1,Good for privet chatting.
1,Very convenient I love it
0,The app wasn't supported.
1,Great app to communicate.
1,Use this app quite often.
0,Ugh. 'Nuff said. Awful idea.
1,I use this app every day this app is life literally I like how we can instant message and face time Facebook friends and I hear they are making this app not just connected to facebook so you can talk to anyone who doesn't have a Facebook account but has the app overall great app.
0,It would be ok IF the circle photo were to go away, after you read the message. The circle photo hangs around and it always IN MY WAY when trying to do other things........get rid of it After you read the message!!!!!
0,Doesn't work at all on my Kindle Fire. Despite many reviews saying the same, I tried it anyway, and when I click "Open" it just shows a white screen and hangs there. This is a Kindle Fire from 20012, so perhaps the older Amazon operating system isn't compatible.
0,they want us to use it but it's not compatible with kindle fire?? really?? c'mon... this is seriously a bunch of crap
0,Very good like tha you donot have to open the message to see that you have one.
1,I love using this app better than regular text. It's a lot of fun and love the cute stickers. Only thing is that I wish I could see who was typing in a group message like it shows when messaging someone alone.
0,I love using messenger. It's an easier way to keep in contact with friends and family. But, there are a few things I wish you would fix: 1) On my Kindle Fire, it will not allow me to send emoji or pictures. 2) I wish the updates would come just like my phone does. 3) The little chat bubble doesn't always show up... Please fix these. Thank you.
0,I was looking forward to downloading this app since the messenger portion on the facebook app is clunky and doesn't send you notifiactions. This is a terrible app for the kindle. The app wouldn't even open and slowed my kindle operating speed. I had to delete it as soon as installed it.
0,I had no particular issues with the app until recently. Now it disappears, doesn't give notifications and other odd behaviors, both on my kindle and android phone. I don't understand what was done to make it so inept.
1,I haven't had messenger very long, but it seems to be a good thing
0,Something about total access to my Stuff.. makes me uncomfortable.
1,Works well. Shows me where messages came from (physical location).
1,Daughter uses this when granddaughter is not on the Fire HD 7. LOL
0,Unable to easily delete notification icon so I deleted the program
0,It's slow and sometimes won't show your messages till the next day
1,Great app. However I can't insert stickers, smilies or attachments
1,Finally THEY BROUGHT FACEBOOK MESSENGER TO KINDLE.. AND IT WORKS!!
0,Why does it work for like a few hours then it won't let me launch
1,LOVE IT INSTANTLY TALK TO MY FRIENDS TO KEEP IN TOUCH ON MY PHONE

0,It's irritating that I have to uninstall and download again every time there's an update because there's no option to update. Overall it's pretty lousy, but it's Facebook and their site sucks, but it keeps me in touch with people and it's free. To clarify, Facebook Messenger didn't used to run on Kindle Fire, but Amazon made Kindle Android compatible in a recently past update because of all the customer complaints about not being able to run so many apps that people use regularly.
0,I have downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire specifically to try the "call" feature in messenger. So far, audio and video have had issues using this feature. Often experience delay in audio so it doesn't match what you see. I have had the same issue and freezing on my smart phone when using the app. For texting it works great.
0,Great app. I haven't run into many glitches. I do not like that if you aren't careful it will give your EXACT location on the app. I had to go into it and disable it, but it a very easy feature to accidentally turn back on if you aren't careful. Hasn't facebook ever heard of stalkers. I wish they would fix this to where it is harder to turn back on. I do not need anyone knowing my exact location!
1,I can share things with my friends from vine, makes it easier to show them a video in private. I'm able to do a lot with messenger. And if my friends send me a message, it will automatically show me. This is awesome, I'm so happy it's on Kindle Fire now.
0,I do not understand why facebook decided we had to have another app to be able to message people. This works yes but it is annoying and now with all the message requests it makes it worse. I don't like it but have to use it I suppose
0,I don't like it, there is little privacy. Anybody can text me directly on my phone and if I want to delete several conversations at one there's not an option for that, I have to go to every conversation and delete them as a single.
0,Why exactly is this required to message on facebook? It never used to. Now it makes constant noises every time I have the internet turned on, and tells people when I'm online no matter what the settings for it are at. REALLY annoying.
0,This is horrible! I have always loved messenger on my phone as well as Facebook. I work full-time online and since the updates it never opens or it crashes! I am losing sales because I can't receive the messages in real time. I have to find a computer at random times throughout my day just to check for messages. It is ridiculous! I'm beyond disappointed, I'm angry and this needs fixed! Facebook and messenger work together but won't work on my app? Yet they sure love billing me for advertisements...pointless to run ads if I can't receive the customers!!! You say give my opinion but you make me pick a star to submit it? No stars in my opinion! Only one star because the app store made me pick it. Fix it!!!
0,This program is a pain in the butt since it is now it own entity apart from facebook. 1. There is no way to LOG OFF. You can only uninstall it. So if I want to lend my tablet to someone and not have them be able to access my messages, Id have to uninstall the whole thing. 2. You cannot access your "others" folder to read messages that may have been waylayed. 3. Wish I could just get my messages from the facebook app like before. However, those scardy cat out there- although it makes you give permission for the app to access your phone book, it WILL NOT make calls on your behalf or anything crazy like that. It is simply for the opportunity to sync your contacts and add your mobile phone number so people can call and text you through the app (and that is an optional feature that you do not have to take advantage of)
1,This app downloaded and installed properly. It runs well on our Kindle Fire HDX with no issues. I downloaded this on my son's tablet so that I could "text" him. Works great for that purpose.

1,I think that Facebook messenger is a good messaging app!
1,I love Facebook massenger . I use it more than I text ..
1,So grate, video calls for free! Is awesome! ??????
1,this is so much better than I phone call because I never want to bother or interrupt anyone. This is great for a quick question and answer.
0,It can get annoying when you are connected to a group and they all start sending messages and you keep getting ones that don't concern you.
1,Haven't used it yet so there may be some bugs, but at least now I can get notifications when I get a Facebook message on my Kindle Fire HD.
0,I like Messenger except for one major problem. It gives you no option to log off. I do not like having an app that does not allow log offs.
1,I will use this app more frequently than even e-mail. thank you for providing this service for me.._l.reslly appreciate the effort.i
0,I hate it!! I did not work with My Kindle Fire and locked my system up! I do not want to reboot after a text message!! Who does????
1,This is fine on my Kindel Fire I don't know why it's getting bad reviews it's good to keep up with my friends and my Pack Members/Meetings
0,You have to be careful all the time or you will post on every person in your group. It to complicated for old people to get started using.
1,Awesome fitness tracker only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the apps needs an overhaul compared to Fitbits app they are being out done.
0,Facebook messenger is usually a good app, but I would never recommend it to an andriod User because I think that the OS can't handle it.
1,Works great very friendly easy to use
1,Good and easy-to-use app for everyone

1,This is challenging but not to the point of frustration. I play some every day, improving my speed and recognition skills. Plus, it's enjoyable and entertaining.
1,Those of you who think it doesn't work on your kindle fire hd, you are wrong, it's working fine for me, and I think it's better than chatting on Facebook itself!
0,I hate messenger- I do not understand why Facebook changed the way we message and require people to sign onto messenger- the old message system was far better-
0,Awful - takes over your device and puts a big circle of the person on messenger. Totally not necessary and blocks the screen of your device. Really dumb idea.
1,Other than the shock of having a face bubble pop up on my phone screen, I really like Messenger. It's easy to use and accessible without logging into Facebook.
1,This is a must when traveling. You do not use your data plan. Plus if you do not international calling on your phone plan this will send messages to FB friends.
1,Messenger is readily accessable. It is easy to use and allows the ability to search for others. It can be use for international messaging with no cost involved.
0,I got it and I forget my password and then I decided to ha e massager off my kindle so if I was you do not git it for your kindle or if you forgot your password
0,The chat and chat heads are fine but the emoji and stickers won't open at all. I'm using this from my kindle fire. Those are the only two issues I seem to have.
1,It does have a couple of nuisance features, but one can learn how to control them. However, it needs to be worked on to handle and it should be 100% intuitive.
0,I don't see the advantage of having this. I was getting my messages on Facebook and happy with that.
1,This is a great tool for those of use who use Facebook . Its easy too use and there when you need it.
0,This app used to work great on my Amazon Fire phone, but now it's bugged out and won't open anything.
1,It is easy to get in touch with someone whose phone numbers you don't have with Facebook Messenger!!!
1,If you have a kindle fire 7 inch then it might work. I tried out everything last night and it worked!
1,The internet is a dirt road which leads to a dead end.. social media is a perfect example of moronism
0,Sucks on kindle fire tablet. Crashes every five seconds, distorted sounds and a lot of lag. Worst app
1,How do you get the little circle with someone's face off the kindle when you've finished the message?
1,it is an excellent application and you can send texts and make calls.... one of the best application!
1,This app works well on my Kindle Fire and so far I've had no issues. Useful app that works smoothly.

1,You can't go wrong with this app. It has an amazing number of Canadian news sources to choose from.
0,what can I say its a messenger app, would like more features and it locks up sometimes and crashes
0,takes up too much space on my phone and tablet.... :( have to uninstall to download phone updates
0,using it, but it was not necessary with the Fire and the other apps I have on it.....love my fire.
1,Facebook Messenger works great on my Kindle Fire HD I wouldn't trade it for the word. I Love it!!!

1,Like it very much
1,yes...it is great
0,To much time spent interacting with a computer (chatting with people you don't know cant see) instead of interacting with real people.
0,Convenient to set up on my phone and is quicker to load than the facebook app itself so it's perfect if I want to just message someone.
1,I love it, so easy, even for this 74 year old great grandma, I take my kindle fire everywhere, and never miss any important messages,,
1,Another interesting story that keeps the reader engrossed to the very end. Rich character development. Can't wait for next installment.
0,It did not work on my kindle fire HD, it should be stated in the description that it will not work on certain items. It was a big pain.
0,It sucks it keeps telling me it's a threat my kindle and so does Facebook's all a threat to my knidle and I can't get help from you all
0,It seems a bit intrusive, but I guess that's what it's supposed to do. I'm sure if you are an 11 year old girl, you'll give it 5 stars.
1,So Handy! No need to get into Facebook itself. Easy to keep in touch with family and friends.
1,Happy to see that it was user friendly. Enjoyed seeing family and friends around the country.
0,Why doesn't any app ever work on Amazon fire phone I'm getting tired of this app system!!!!!!!!
0,The site is great but no matter where I am the signal drops the chat and takes a moment to fix.
1,I JUST LOVE ON AMAZON FIRES I CAN SCYPE I CAN MEZZAGE AVERYTHING LIKE CRAZY!!!!????????
0,It works good with my kids kindle fires, but they can't video chat or voice call their cousins.
1,Yes, it asks for lots of permissions, but so do most apps. LOVE THIS AND CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT!
1,this helps me contact the ones I cant see or talk to and lets me do a hole lot more than others
1,It's a way to communicate when you don't have a phone number or email to contact an individual.
0,Nice when able to use over just WiFi and no phone service. But other then that Facebook is lame
1,Great
0,sucks
1,great
1,great
1,GREAT
1,Great
1,Loved
0,Whoever created this wasn't the brightest crayon in the box. It's a stupid app. My thought is: why not just go on Facebook and post a message to your friend/family member there???
0,Incessantly pushy! They INSIST that you allow push notifications. If it weren't the only way I can message my kid right now, I'd push it right off a cliff and into digital hell!
0,the previous one within facebook was way better. If it is not broke, don't fix it. Wish people weren't forced to get it to continue sending messages through facebook

0,Its a kind of Ok app! Not that great though....
1,I use this app all the time and it's working just fine both on my Kindle fire HD and my fire HD 7
1,The bubbles are not working on fire phone, when you click it the phone froze. but the rest its ok

0,Not very organized.... Prefer the original Facebook app , but can't get it on my kindle anymore!
1,It's ok on my kindenl fire but its got a few bugs and glitches if not it would get ???? from me
0,I did not order this. I do not deal with face book or other social media stuff on the internet.
0,If you want to message someone on Facebook on a mobile device you HAVE to use this horrible app.
1,Cool i like it because you can text people that are not on your contacts..but are on facebook:))
1,I use it to talk to my mom and it is great IDK why people are saying it sucks but I have had my Kindle for almost 3 years it has indents, it has fallen a lot and the messanger works perfectly
0,it was okay however it took too much memory for me to keep, so I felt that it was one of the things that I could let go of. I tend to use face book just to look at the articles not to chat.
0,I downloaded this, only to find after doing so that it will not work with Kindle Fire. this should be noted before encouraging customers to download! Dick move on both companies' part, IMHO.
1,Just received a kindle fire and have relocated for the winter. Facebook Messenger allows me to not only talk to my family but to see them. A treat for me. I am so happy to have this feature.
0,It's a good way to get up people that don't have service on their cell by they do have access to WiFi. But only gets three stars because of all of the permissions needed to have it as a app.
0,It's useful but...it would be nice if you could log out of an account somewhere. I have a shared tablet so it's not good when someone else can just see my messages because I can't log out.
1,I don't know why everybody else is saying it doesn't work but mine is working fine. My messages go through perfectly and it tells me when I get a new text . Maybe it just likes my kindle :)
1,I am very happy with my Facebook Messenger. I can communicate with my friends and family in Europe and here in US as well. It's a great feature and,... it's free. No more paid phone calls.
0,App will not install on 5th gen. Kindle..... With inferior audio and video, what other purpose could this cheaper kindle serve if not to communicate.? No Facebook, no messenger???come on!!
0,My phone or tablet hasn't worked right since I installed it. Happened before and I took it off, thought maybe they fixed the problem. Must not have, now my kindle wont load pages properly.
1,Very happy with this. Used while I was in Ecuador. Love the emoticons.
1,guys everyone it's compatible I guess it doesn't work for your kindle
1,I am a new tablet amazon fire user and I like the FB messenger so far.
1,This app is great it works so good with kindle fire hd. Love it!!!!!:)
0,Plz make Instagram available for Kindle Fire . This is just messed up.
1,This app makes it easier to communicate with other people on facebook.
0,I do not like that the picture stay on my Kindle. They are in the way.
1,Everyone says it doesn't work on kindle fire and mine works perfectly.
0,Messaged works great for me. It gives me one more way to get in touch.

1,I really like it.
1,works pretty good
1,Works as expected
1,Great. Use alot.
1,I really like it!
1,I love this app!!
0,Bad phone quality
1,Will buy again!!!
0,it crash too much
1,Great tool, that's only gotten better, with the addition of video charting. The video part is courtesy of Skype, and is rather nice, without having to install additional software or apps.
1,i gave it a five because it is compatible with my kindle fire hd and i got the first generation.it lets me text every one but,one thing i got to say is that i dont no how to log out of it.
1,I cant update this app..
1,for all the people that see the reviews that say its.not compatible.... there wrong it does work all the time they just dont know how to do it so go ahead and download it. it really works
1,Great new way to get in touch with someone. I was having trouble reaching my nephew in China through several other means but he was able to get Messenger when none of the others made it.
1,I like using Messenger. I do not have to be in Faceoook to use it. The is a small round icon with my friend's profile pic that pops up and an alert sound so that I know I have a message.
0,You see, the application works fine. But the only thing is....I never get alerts saying I got a message or not! Aside from that, it works great. If THIS can be fixed, I would give it a 5.
0,Lame. If I have to have this to access messages then why does it not work on all devices? Not that I can't just log on from computer, just annoying if this is the device I am using.
0,This app sucks for anything Amazon. Won't let you receive your messages. Tap on the message and it freezes everytime. A waste of time installing it. Should've jus stayed with what I had.
1,I enjoy the conversations on facebook. A great way to stay connected with family and friends. The pics, peoms and media always give you food for thought! Inspirational and informative.
1,Love it
1,Awesome
1,Love it
1,GREAT!!

1,Very handy for on the go messaging when phone service is problematic for texts.
0,Sucks on my Android phone, sucks on my Android Kindle. Just don't even bother.
0,Thanks to the other Kindle Fire users for warning before I tried to download!!!
0,It freezes up a lot. I don't know why,but it only happens on this and Facebook.
0,Should not need to download app for this. Can not get it on all of my devices.
1,So far it's great. I am still learning how to use it, but it seems easy to use.
0,Downloaded this to my Kindle. This like Facebook has a trojan horse and or worm
1,I love messenger because you can send secure messages to the person you desire!
1,I like it! But I need to change my Kindle, because it does not have microphone.
1,really comes in handy whenyou want to talk one on one with somebody on Facebook
